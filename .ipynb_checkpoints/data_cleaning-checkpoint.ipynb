      "Poverty represents a worldwide crisis. It is the ugliest epidemic in a region, which could infect countries in the most debilitating ways. To tackle this issue, rich countries need to help those in need and give a hand when possible. I agree that there are several ways of aiding poor countries other than financial aid, like providing countries in need with engineers, workers, and soldiers who would build infrastructure. Building universities, hospitals, and roadways. By having a solid infrastructure, poor countries would be able to monetise their profits and build a stronger and more profitable economy which would help them in the long term. Once unprivilged countries find their niche, the major hurdle would be passed and would definitely pave the way for much brighter future. However, I do disagree that financial aid does not solve poverty, it does if used properly and efficiently. The most determining factor if financial aid would be the way to go, is by identifying what type of poor countries' representative are dealing with. Some countries will have a responsible leader and some will not, with that being said, implementing a strategy, to distinguish responsible leaders from others, would tailor the type of aid rich countries could use. An example, A clear report and constant observation would be applied to track the progress and how this type of aid is being monetized. In summary, types of aid varies from country to another, and tailoring the type of aid is of paramount importance to solve this problem that had huge toll on poor countries.\n",
      "------------\n",
      "Human beings are facing many challenges nowadays. Poverty is always an critical topic among countries, especially the poverty in developing countries. Developed countries frequently offer financial support to poor countries but the poverty still exist. Experts are arguing that developed countries should consider other solutions to help solve the poverty issue. I believe this is a much better direction compare to money support only.\n",
      "Money is essential to many factors like food, contruction and hospital. With money provided by developed countries, govenment can improve the inforstructure, supporting poor family with food, building more houses for the poor people, builing more schools to support children's education, which is critical for people to get out of poverty.\n",
      "But money cannot solve everything. The poverty caused by many reasons like lacking of resource and experienced governor. None of them could be solved by simply offering money to the goverment. Besides, money could cause a bad habit to the governor, they may reply on the financial support too much. If the financial support ended someday, which could happen anytime in the current circurmestance, it will cause big trouble again.\n",
      "Devevloped countries should focus on a sophicated solution instead of just providing money. For example, they can help poor countries to build manufacturing industry, and give certain subsides for the customer who buy directly from them. Developed countries also can send experienced instructor to help governer in poor countries build a better government system to improve the efficiency of governance, authority of justice, to make sure company feel safe to invest in these developing counties, which could have a long term benifit for the people there.\n",
      "Overall, I am agree that money could help to solve the poverty but without other support from different functions, it may not the best solution for poverty.\n",

      "Whether countries should only invest facilities and training on their elite athletes in order to win international competitions or give the same opportunities for all remains a big discussion. In this essay I will explain both views and why I think participation for all is the way which brings positive consequences.\n",
      "Those supporting the first view believe that the odds to win are only high if the countries invest specialised facilities on their top sportmen. This is because, only athletes trained to reach the highest performance guarantee high scores. For example, it is known that China sends only its elite sportmen to compete in the Olympics and statistically, they usually win numbers of medals.\n",
      "On the other hand, those who support sports facilities and training for all athletes consider that non-top ones can also have great opportunities to succeed. For instance, Diego Maradona, a Argentinian soccer player, never played in a professional field, on the contrary, he was discovered playing in an old field located in a poor village. This means that by providing facilities for all, gifted sportmen might be discovered and they can make history too.\n",
      "In my opinion, as a supporter of the second view, I believe that permiting everyone to train and use sports facilities is the best way to achieve international sports. For me, winning is as essential as participation. Besides, this way leads to find natural talents among the local population, which is inspiring for others in similar circunstances.\n",
      "In conclusion, although the two positions have strong arguments. I think that the one supporting facilities for all people is the one that can bring positive developments to achieve sports events. Participation and inclusiveness may help to find gifted athletes among ordinary people.\n",
      "------------\n",
      "Sports is an essential part to most of us , some of us consider it a lifestyle and others consider it a job or source of income , So it's a huge part in our live.\n",
      "Building specialized facilities to improve and develop athelets levels it's kind of encouragment to this category of people , and it reflects enormous benefit to them. Either by providing to them the professional training or by make them ready to international competitions. But narrowing the attention of sports to a specific category and ignore other categories actually doesn't sounds a good idea.\n",
      "Athelets consider as a important part of the community but the don't cover most of it, and other people have the right to have sport facilities that suits their level and everyone whatever is it beginner or professional can use it.\n",
      "Sports is a public interest that doesn't include specific people in it, and it's important to all genders and all ages, so providing facilities to specific ones can end up with unfairness results. In other hand , providing this facilities to all public people will lead to increase in sport awarness and end up with more people having healthy lifesyle.\n",
      "In conclousion , according to medical facts said that's doing sport daily and make it essence in your life decreases heart attacks and raise the life quality, specified just the athelets people with sports facilities is undesireable decision. In other hand , raising the number of gyms and sports areas will conclude with healthier society.\n",
      "------------\n",
      "International sports events require the most well-trained athletes for each country, in order to achieve this goal countries make an effort to build infrastructure designed to train top athletes. Although this policy can indeed make fewer sports facilities for ordinary people, investing in the best athletes is vital to develop competitive sports performances in each country.\n",
      "On the one hand, building specific infrastructure for the best athletes is crucial in order to get better results at international sports events such as The Olympics or the World Cup. The importance of getting better results is that it creates awareness of the importance of sports in society and motivates more people to do a sport. In this way, investing in these developments can help countries to develop an integral sport policy that can benefit everyone.\n",
      "On the other hand, one can argue that a negative effect could be that less infrastructure is built for the rest of the people. However, people who practice a sport in their daily life do not necessarily need some facilities to do sports. For example, people often use public spaces to do sports such as running or doing yoga at the nearest park to their home. So, for people who is not top athletes there could be some alternatives for sports facility that ,is not the case for training top athletes.\n",
      "To sum up, I strongly believe countries should invest in specialised infrastructure for their best athletes because in the long term is going to generate more motivation to do sports, to invest in sports at schools and therefore to build more sports infrastructure for everyone.\n",
