1,2,"Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Poverty represents a worldwide crisis. It is the ugliest epidemic in a region, which could infect countries in the most debilitating ways. To tackle this issue, rich countries need to help those in need and give a hand when possible. I agree that there are several ways of aiding poor countries other than financial aid, like providing countries in need with engineers, workers, and soldiers who would build infrastructure. Building universities, hospitals, and roadways. By having a solid infrastructure, poor countries would be able to monetise their profits and build a stronger and more profitable economy which would help them in the long term. Once unprivilged countries find their niche, the major hurdle would be passed and would definitely pave the way for much brighter future. However, I do disagree that financial aid does not solve poverty, it does if used properly and efficiently. The most determining factor if financial aid would be the way to go, is by identifying what type of poor countries' representative are dealing with. Some countries will have a responsible leader and some will not, with that being said, implementing a strategy, to distinguish responsible leaders from others, would tailor the type of aid rich countries could use. An example, A clear report and constant observation would be applied to track the progress and how this type of aid is being monetized. In summary, types of aid varies from country to another, and tailoring the type of aid is of paramount importance to solve this problem that had huge toll on poor countries.",,,,,,6.5,"While many believe that wealthy nations should give more than just financial aid to poorer countries, I think a balanced approach is necessary to effectively address poverty. Direct monetary support can certainly help with immediate needs, such as food shortages or disaster relief, but it often fails to create long-term change, especially if mismanagement or corruption is involved. Instead, developed countries could provide expertise and technology to help poorer nations improve essential sectors like education, healthcare, and infrastructure. For example, sending skilled professionals to train local workers or partnering to establish sustainable energy sources may empower communities to become self-sufficient. However, I do not agree that financial aid should be completely disregarded; when provided transparently and with accountability measures, it can offer crucial support and complement other forms of assistance. Ultimately, a combination of targeted financial aid and long-term capacity-building initiatives is most likely to make a real difference in breaking the cycle of poverty."
3,2,"Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Human beings are facing many challenges nowadays. Poverty is always an critical topic among countries, especially the poverty in developing countries. Developed countries frequently offer financial support to poor countries but the poverty still exist. Experts are arguing that developed countries should consider other solutions to help solve the poverty issue. I believe this is a much better direction compare to money support only.
Money is essential to many factors like food, contruction and hospital. With money provided by developed countries, govenment can improve the inforstructure, supporting poor family with food, building more houses for the poor people, builing more schools to support children's education, which is critical for people to get out of poverty.
But money cannot solve everything. The poverty caused by many reasons like lacking of resource and experienced governor. None of them could be solved by simply offering money to the goverment. Besides, money could cause a bad habit to the governor, they may reply on the financial support too much. If the financial support ended someday, which could happen anytime in the current circurmestance, it will cause big trouble again.
Devevloped countries should focus on a sophicated solution instead of just providing money. For example, they can help poor countries to build manufacturing industry, and give certain subsides for the customer who buy directly from them. Developed countries also can send experienced instructor to help governer in poor countries build a better government system to improve the efficiency of governance, authority of justice, to make sure company feel safe to invest in these developing counties, which could have a long term benifit for the people there.
Overall, I am agree that money could help to solve the poverty but without other support from different functions, it may not the best solution for poverty.",,,,,,5.5,"The issue of global poverty remains a serious problem, even though wealthy countries have been sending financial aid to poorer nations for many years. While giving money is helpful in emergency situations like natural disasters or famine, it does not always lead to meaningful long-term improvement. I mostly agree that developed nations should offer other forms of assistance besides just financial support. First, simply giving money can sometimes mean that funds are misused or lost to corruption, especially in countries with weak government systems. Also, poor countries may become dependent on aid and not try to create their own solutions. Instead, developed countries could share knowledge, technology, and skills by sending teachers, doctors, and engineers to support local communities. They could help set up reliable healthcare and education systems, train local leaders, and encourage fair trade to help these countries grow their own economies. In my opinion, while direct financial aid can help in some situations, supporting sustainable development and capacity building is far more effective in addressing the root causes of poverty for the long term."
5,2,"Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Whether countries should only invest facilities and training on their elite athletes in order to win international competitions or give the same opportunities for all remains a big discussion. In this essay I will explain both views and why I think participation for all is the way which brings positive consequences.
Those supporting the first view believe that the odds to win are only high if the countries invest specialised facilities on their top sportmen. This is because, only athletes trained to reach the highest performance guarantee high scores. For example, it is known that China sends only its elite sportmen to compete in the Olympics and statistically, they usually win numbers of medals.
On the other hand, those who support sports facilities and training for all athletes consider that non-top ones can also have great opportunities to succeed. For instance, Diego Maradona, a Argentinian soccer player, never played in a professional field, on the contrary, he was discovered playing in an old field located in a poor village. This means that by providing facilities for all, gifted sportmen might be discovered and they can make history too.
In my opinion, as a supporter of the second view, I believe that permiting everyone to train and use sports facilities is the best way to achieve international sports. For me, winning is as essential as participation. Besides, this way leads to find natural talents among the local population, which is inspiring for others in similar circunstances.
In conclusion, although the two positions have strong arguments. I think that the one supporting facilities for all people is the one that can bring positive developments to achieve sports events. Participation and inclusiveness may help to find gifted athletes among ordinary people.",,,,,,6.5,"There is an ongoing debate about whether nations should focus their resources on elite sports facilities for a select group of athletes aiming for international success or offer accessible sports infrastructure for the community at large. Those in favor of building highly specialized centers argue that elite athletes require advanced equipment and coaching in order to compete on the world stage, as this gives them a competitive edge and brings national pride through medals and records, as seen in countries like the United States. However, some believe that this strategy excludes the wider public and ignores the potential of finding new talent in unexpected places. For example, there are countless stories of athletes who started training in public places and rose to fame because they had the space and encouragement to pursue sports. In my opinion, making sports facilities available to everyone is more positive; not only does it support finding future champions, but it also encourages health, teamwork, and motivation across society. Ultimately, while concentrating on elite facilities may bring short-term gains in international competitions, investing in widespread sports opportunities produces lasting benefits and can help uncover hidden talents."
7,2,"Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Sports is an essential part to most of us , some of us consider it a lifestyle and others consider it a job or source of income , So it's a huge part in our live.
Building specialized facilities to improve and develop athelets levels it's kind of encouragment to this category of people , and it reflects enormous benefit to them. Either by providing to them the professional training or by make them ready to international competitions. But narrowing the attention of sports to a specific category and ignore other categories actually doesn't sounds a good idea.
Athelets consider as a important part of the community but the don't cover most of it, and other people have the right to have sport facilities that suits their level and everyone whatever is it beginner or professional can use it.
Sports is a public interest that doesn't include specific people in it, and it's important to all genders and all ages, so providing facilities to specific ones can end up with unfairness results. In other hand , providing this facilities to all public people will lead to increase in sport awarness and end up with more people having healthy lifesyle.
In conclousion , according to medical facts said that's doing sport daily and make it essence in your life decreases heart attacks and raise the life quality, specified just the athelets people with sports facilities is undesireable decision. In other hand , raising the number of gyms and sports areas will conclude with healthier society.",,,,,,5.5,"International sports success is often a source of national pride, and some countries focus on this by building advanced facilities to prepare top athletes for global competitions. Such specialized centers have clear advantages, as they allow elite sportsmen to reach their highest potential through professional coaching and state-of-the-art resources. This could lead to more medals and increased international recognition for the country. However, focusing only on the best athletes may leave the general public with fewer opportunities to exercise or play sports for health and enjoyment. This can make playing sports seem exclusive and could discourage everyday people, young or old, from leading an active lifestyle. In my view, it is better if countries balance their efforts by not only supporting elite facilities but also ensuring that basic sport spaces are available for everyone, because public health and community wellbeing are just as important as international victories."
9,2,"Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.","International sports events require the most well-trained athletes for each country, in order to achieve this goal countries make an effort to build infrastructure designed to train top athletes. Although this policy can indeed make fewer sports facilities for ordinary people, investing in the best athletes is vital to develop competitive sports performances in each country.
On the one hand, building specific infrastructure for the best athletes is crucial in order to get better results at international sports events such as The Olympics or the World Cup. The importance of getting better results is that it creates awareness of the importance of sports in society and motivates more people to do a sport. In this way, investing in these developments can help countries to develop an integral sport policy that can benefit everyone.
On the other hand, one can argue that a negative effect could be that less infrastructure is built for the rest of the people. However, people who practice a sport in their daily life do not necessarily need some facilities to do sports. For example, people often use public spaces to do sports such as running or doing yoga at the nearest park to their home. So, for people who is not top athletes there could be some alternatives for sports facility that ,is not the case for training top athletes.
To sum up, I strongly believe countries should invest in specialised infrastructure for their best athletes because in the long term is going to generate more motivation to do sports, to invest in sports at schools and therefore to build more sports infrastructure for everyone.",,,,,,9.0,"Many nations choose to invest heavily in specialised sports facilities dedicated to training elite athletes, with the aim of achieving success on the international stage. This strategy can bring prestige and a sense of national pride when top athletes excel at events like the Olympics, and having cutting-edge training centers allows these individuals to reach their highest potential. On the positive side, such investments can generate role models for young people and draw greater interest in physical activity throughout the country, which may ultimately have a ripple effect, inspiring broader participation in sports. Conversely, prioritising facilities for elite athletes may mean fewer resources are dedicated to sports opportunities for the general public. This could limit access for ordinary citizens to engage in healthy physical activities, as many people may rely on public facilities to stay active. In my view, while it is important for countries to support their top athletes, focusing too much on specialised facilities can neglect the wider population’s need for accessible sports infrastructure. A balanced approach, where both elite training centers and community facilities are developed, would be the most positive way forward, as it encourages both international competitiveness and the everyday well-being of citizens."
11,2,"Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Athletes to be on the top need to have high-end facilities that a country can provide for them to be able to improve their strengths and skills. Some government opted to build facilities exclusively for training athletes for international sports goals, instead of building establishments for everyone to have the liberty of using the sports facilities. From my perspective, this phenomena is a negative development.
Being able to discover an individual's potential, they need to have a support from any form of sources. Establishing sports facilities can help people to discover their own interests, talents and even skills in learning new things. Centers which offer utilities, equipments and state-of-the-art tools that provide learning sports can be a great advantage to people who want to train themselves on the things that can awaken their interests when it comes to sports.
In addition, building these kind of establishments, not only for the purpose to train top athletes, but also for people to immerse themselves to different variaties of activities can help them socialize more with their peers. This is extremely beneficial that aside from doing sports that they are into, they get to play along with peers, discover one's potential and also learning from one another. Furthermore, these individuals can also have the future to be one of top athletes that a country can have.
In conclusion, although there are countries that chose to have their sports establishments exclusively for training top athletes, I assert that these that actions can be lead to negative feedbacks. Government should allow everyone the privilege to use and avail facilities that can hone an individual's talents, skills and dexterity when it comes to sports and this can also be immensely benefical for both country and citizen alike.",,,,,,5.5,"When it comes to international sports success, there are countries that focus on building exclusive centers only for their top athletes, believing this helps them win more medals or gain recognition worldwide. On the one hand, constructing specialised facilities gives elite athletes the perfect environment to grow their talents, access advanced resources, and receive expert training, which might increase a country’s chance of standing out in global competitions. However, this also means regular people are often left with fewer places to exercise or play sports, which can limit their opportunities to get fit, discover their abilities, or even dream of becoming top players themselves. If sports facilities were open for everyone, more citizens could enjoy healthy lifestyles, mingle with others, and possibly nurture hidden talents who might one day represent the country at a global event. In my view, while building specialised facilities seems helpful for current athletes, it restricts the wider community and stifles the development of future talent. Therefore, I think providing access to quality sports centers for everyone is a much more positive path, as it benefits not only individual well-being but the country as a whole."

In my opinion i think both ideas together can contribue a very successful achievement in international sports for the country.
Building highly specialised facilities by the country to train its top athletes can help the athletes to get an apropriate training, give them the chance to progress faster and to be qualified to win or host international compititions like olympics, for example if the country invists and build a large swimming center to train professional swimmers, it is highly likely for them to win and get medals in international compititions.
On the other side providing various sport centers for the public use will encourage people to train and practice all kinds of sports more which leads to gaining more athletes to represent the country, for example allowing and giving access to a young talented girls to practice their favorite sport like football, ice skating, bascketball and more will give them the apportinety to become a professional athletes who would benifit and represent the country.
In conclusion, i think both invisting in building specialised facilities to train the top athletes to win and host an international compititions, and invisting in providing sport centers for everyone to use to encourage and build more athletes could be benificial and counribue a highly international achievement in sports for the country it self.",,,,,,6.0,"Many countries focus their resources on building advanced training centers for their best athletes, believing this will help them win more medals in global competitions, while others prefer to create sports facilities that are open for everyone to use. On one hand, having specialised training centers for top athletes gives them the best tools and environment to develop their skills and compete at the highest level, which can help the country achieve international recognition in sports. For example, if a nation invests in high-tech gyms or running tracks only for professional athletes, it could improve their chances of winning gold medals at events like the Olympics. On the other hand, making public sports facilities widely available allows ordinary people to participate in sports, leading to a healthier population and potentially discovering new talented athletes who might otherwise be missed. If children have easy access to swimming pools, football fields, or basketball courts near their homes, they might develop their talents over time and eventually represent their country. In my opinion, while specialised training centers are important for success at the highest level, it is more positive to provide sports opportunities for everyone, as this not only creates a larger pool of future athletes but also promotes an active and healthy society overall."

In my opinion, i think that building specialised facilities to encahnce top athletes potential is essential and its such a positive development, i also think that any sports player must have a good body and eat healthy food, because a good physique can improve movement,stamina and strength etc specially in the sports that depend alot on the body as an exmaple football, basketball, table tennis, swimming etc, and healthy food helps the athlete to achieve the physique that he wants and give him even more power and activity.
builiding specialised facilities is important because they will train them specificly on certain things in order to make them the best, also they can focus on the athletes alone they are not going to be disturbed by people, every athlete with his coach, and that place only will be for the proffessnial athletes, as an example in table tennis professional players play in their clubs because they have the best enviroment to be better, they have amazing equipment such as the table the racket etc, and they have the coaches all over the place, and they can play with the players because they are all professional athletes.
additionally those player have to be very fit, all of the top players are in extremely good shape their legs are built of metal in order to help them move quick in the table and the muscules helps with stamina if they are strong they can play more without getting tired.
So yes the facilities are very helpful and crucial to reach the top and they have to follow a specific diet from the professional coaches.",,,,,,6.5,"Some countries focus on constructing specialised sports facilities to train their top athletes and help them win international medals, while others prefer to build sports centers that serve all people. On one hand, building facilities for elite athletes can raise the level of sports in a country and help it become more successful on the world stage. These specialised centers offer better equipment, expert coaches, and more focused training environments without distractions, which makes athletes stronger and more competitive at international events. On the other hand, some people believe it is more important to build public sports facilities, because when everyone has access to affordable sports centers, it improves the health of the population and also helps discover new talents who might become future champions. In my opinion, although there are benefits to training elite athletes in specialised centers, it is more positive to invest in public facilities so that everyone has the chance to play sports, stay healthy, and even be discovered as a skilled athlete in the future, which can benefit the entire country in the long run."
17,2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","There is currently a material issue that while the majority of students are eager to learn business or art in university, there are only a few students who want to study science, leading to numerous negative effects on community. With respect to this matter, there are also a wide variety of factors that influence the decision of students to not study science subjects.
It is undeniable that there are many reasons why undergraduates avoid studying science. A classic example of this is that science is extremely difficult to understand. In order to fully comprehend a particular scientific phenomenon, students have to learn complex theories that cause the phenomena. Therefore, they tend to choose other subjects that are easier to understand. Another common reason is a small amount of salary for working in scientific fields. When student choose subjects to study at university, they tend to enroll in an area that they could make a lot of money from having that knowledge. Since science career does not offer high remuneration, student possibly prefer to study other subjects such as business which offers higher salary instead.
It is true that there are many negative consequences on society of having less undergraduates studying science. One clear impact of this is the decreasing in innovation. This is because scientific comprehension is a mandatory requirement for creating an innovation. Hence, having only a few people who understand science will inevitably hold the creation of modern innovation. Furthermore, the current environmental crisis, such as an increase in global temperature, would perhaps reach a point of no return. Since the crisis relates to environment which is one of scientific aspects, having a small number of attention from students would lead to less social pressure to address this crisis properly.
In conclusion, it is the fact that science is complicated and people who have scientific knowledge can make less money than those who are expertise in other areas, resulting in less popularity in learning about science for university students. Moreover, with the rise in this problem, this trend possibly suspends the creation of new innovation and deteriorate the current environmental issues, which are two most crucial matters for society.",,,,,,8.5,"In many parts of the world, it has become obvious that a decreasing number of students are drawn towards science majors in university, and this trend is driven by several key factors, with harmful outcomes for society as a whole. To begin with, science subjects are often seen as more demanding than other fields because they require not only a firm grasp of mathematics but also the ability to deal with abstract theories and undertake challenging laboratory work. Many students find the workload and complexity stressful, leading them to opt for majors they perceive as easier and more enjoyable, such as social sciences or arts. Furthermore, jobs in science often lack the financial rewards and immediate recognition that careers in business or technology-related areas can provide. When young people see limited job prospects or lower salaries in scientific professions, they are discouraged from pursuing this traditionally respected discipline. The consequences of this shift are severe and widespread. For example, if fewer undergraduates specialize in science, there could be a shortage of trained individuals to fill roles in healthcare, engineering, and research, slowing technological progress and potentially putting the public at risk. Additionally, as fewer students are equipped to solve scientific problems, issues like disease outbreaks, environmental pollution, or climate change may worsen due to a lack of innovative solutions. Ultimately, the decline in interest in science subjects at university is a complex issue rooted in both academic challenges and economic factors, and if it is not addressed, it could impede a nation’s growth and weaken its ability to solve urgent problems."
19,2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","In recent years, many countries have reported a decrease in the number of students choosing science subjects in universities. This is a concerning trend that can have a profound impact on society. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons behind this problem and its implications.
The first reason for fewer students selecting science subjects is likely that these courses are difficult to comprehend. In general, science courses such as mathematics and physics involve complex theories, formulas, and concepts that require a great deal of hard work to understand. Furthermore, they are often taught in a theoretical manner and fail to show students how this knowledge can be used in real life. In other words, it may seem impractical for them to learn science courses. Lastly, it may be hard to acquire a practical job through these theoretical subjects in the future. As a result, students may give up studying science because they find scientific studies unappealing, impractical, and not promising for their future careers.
Consequently, the lack of students studying science subjects can have a significant impact on society. First and foremost, there may not be enough qualified scientists and teachers to teach the theoretical foundation of technology, medicine, and engineering. This could lead to slow progress in these areas, and society may suffer as a result. Moreover, the decline in the number of science students could lead to a shortage of scientists for research and development in industry, which would have a negative impact on the nation's economy.
To sum up, the decreasing number of students selecting science courses in universities is a worrying phenomenon. The main reasons for this are the difficulty of science courses and the lack of job opportunities in science after studies. This could have a negative impact on society, as there may not be enough qualified scientists to pursue research, and this could impede progress in fields such as technology and medicine.",,,,,,8.5,"In recent times, a growing number of universities around the world are observing a drop in student enrollment in science-related subjects. This issue stems from several key factors, and it can have serious effects on society as a whole. Firstly, many students perceive science subjects like chemistry, physics, and biology as particularly demanding, often requiring strong mathematical and analytical skills. Compared to arts or business courses, science classes may require more time for studying and lab work, which can be off-putting for those looking for easier paths to graduation. Additionally, there is sometimes a misconception that science degrees do not lead to as many lucrative job opportunities, especially when compared to fields such as business or law. Students might worry about long years of study and limited career options after graduation if they choose science. As a result, fewer young people are attracted to these disciplines. This trend can cause significant problems for society because scientific knowledge is crucial in today’s world. With fewer students entering scientific fields, there may be a shortage of skilled professionals, such as engineers, doctors, and researchers. This lack of innovation and expertise could slow down economic growth, reduce competitiveness, and make it harder to solve complex challenges like disease, climate change, or technological advancement. To conclude, the declining interest in science among university students is a matter of concern due to both its underlying causes and the risks it poses to societal development and progress."
21,2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","In this essay we will talk about why in so many countries students do not prefer to choose science as a subject in the universities. There are plenty of reasons for this problem and what effect does this have on society? This essay will suggest many reasons for this problem.
The main reason of this problem is lack of trained Math and Science teachers. If students do not get proper foundation and motivation in their school life to persue science, They will develop Science and Math phobia. Due to which they will prefer to choose any other stream than science to pursue their higher education.
Eventually, this will effect society in many ways. If students stopped taking science as their majors, their will be shortage of doctors. Because of that, people will suffer from many health problems. Secondly, if students do not take science as their major there will be no placement of science teachers for the future generation. According to me, Government should take firm steps to stop this from happening. There must be some training or some programs to keep teachers up to date to enhance their teaching.This will enable teachers to make science subjects enjoyable for students, for instance, teachers may incorporate technology in the learning process.
To conclude, I belive that government and teachers should take the responsibility to create the environment to learn these subjects in a fun way. This will, eventually, increase the number of students enrolling for Science Subjects in coming future. Otherwise, it may have negative impact on society which will not be a good sign for any country.",,,,,,6.5,"In recent years, a noticeable decline in the number of students selecting science subjects at the university level has emerged in many countries. One primary reason for this trend is that science courses are often perceived as difficult and demanding compared to other fields, causing students to feel intimidated or unconfident about their abilities. Additionally, there is a lack of awareness about the wide range of career opportunities that science degrees can offer, while other disciplines such as business or arts are often seen as more straightforward paths to employment. This issue is also worsened by the portrayal of science as less creative and more rigid in schools, making students lose interest early on. The effects of this trend on society can be quite serious. With fewer students entering science, there could be a lack of skilled professionals such as engineers, researchers, and healthcare workers, all of whom play critical roles in technological innovation and public health. This shortage could slow down economic development and make it harder for countries to solve important problems such as disease, climate change, and technological advancement. Therefore, it is important for educators and policymakers to highlight the value of science education and make science subjects more appealing and accessible, so more students are inspired to pursue these crucial fields."
23,2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","Recently, more and more students choose to study finance, management or other subjects instead of science in university around the world. There are many reasons contribute to this phenomenon and this would definetely impose negative influences on our society.
In terms of the factors, the reason is mainly due to the job market. Firstly, we have to admit that the number of science job vacancies in the market is significantly lower than the other occupations, like the nurse, the accountant, the lawyer and so on. Besides this, the science is comparatively difficult than the other subjects. If you want to be a qualified scientist, you are more likely to spend more time on learning and researching, maybe three years more than the other subjects. So, very naturally, few people would like to take the risk of learning science.
However, science does play an extremely important role in our society. If not enough people study science, it may impede the development of the country. Science represents the future of our nation because it could help to improve the development of technology and then make new technologies into pratical products. A good example can be seen in the United States, which has experienced a huge development in science during the past decades and has created a lot of advanced products, such as the Microsoft and Artificial intelligence, which has bring great benefits to this country in return and make it become the most powerful nation in the world. In contrast, if very few people learning science, the nation may remain at a standstill and lose its competitiveness.
In conclusion, although few people want to study science, the government should take efficient measures to encourage the public to study this subject to help our society improving continuously in the long future.",,,,,,5.5,"In recent years, it has become common in many countries for students to avoid science-related courses at university in favor of humanities, business, or social studies. This trend is caused by a variety of factors, the most important being the perception that science subjects are very challenging and require much more study and dedication. Many students fear that they may not get good results if they choose these difficult subjects, and thus prefer to select easier courses that seem to offer a quicker or more secure path to graduation and employment. Additionally, in some countries, jobs in science fields are fewer and often do not offer higher salaries compared to other professions like law, business, or medicine, which discourages students even further. The effect on society of fewer people studying science can be significant. Without a strong pool of scientists and engineers, a country may fall behind in innovation and technological development, which could restrict progress in important areas such as healthcare, environmental protection, and industry. Moreover, the lack of interest in science education may lead to a shortage of specialists who are able to solve complex problems that our modern world faces. To prevent these negative consequences, governments and universities should work together to make science subjects more appealing and accessible, ensuring that society can continue to advance in the future."
25,2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","It is a serious problem that there is an inadequate number of students who tend to select science as their major subject in universities in many countries. In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.
The main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.
This trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. If there are not enough scientists, the whole scientific ability will decrease. Not only will the government pay extra money to other foreign countries to buy the required technology such as military equipment, but the public needs to spend more time and pay more effort to maintain the international standard production rate of a country. It is extremely dangerous that a nation easily suffers from a financial crisis and, finally, it influences the living standard of its citizens and causes damage to its financial systems.
In summary, while science is regarded as a ""useless"" subject because of its narrow career path and low success rate, it is vital that the economic systems would be affected if a country develop without scientists.",,,,,,7.0,"In recent years, a noticeable decline in the number of students selecting science subjects at the university level has become a concern in many nations. One principal reason for this issue is that science degrees are often considered both demanding and not as lucrative or secure as other fields such as business or information technology. For example, the rigorous coursework and long hours required in scientific disciplines may discourage students who prefer smoother academic journeys with more immediate job prospects upon graduation. Furthermore, science careers can sometimes appear to lack clear pathways, and positions for researchers or lab-based scientists are often limited and highly competitive, leading many students to fear that their efforts may not be rewarded with stable employment. This lack of interest in science has significant social implications. As fewer students graduate with relevant skills, countries may find themselves with insufficient experts to tackle critical problems like disease outbreaks, climate change, and technological development. Over time, such shortages force nations to depend heavily on foreign expertise and imported technology, which can weaken local industries and increase vulnerability in vital sectors like healthcare and energy. Therefore, although studying science may seem less appealing due to job uncertainty and academic difficulty, a lasting neglect of these subjects could ultimately hinder a country’s innovation, resilience, and ability to improve the quality of life for its citizens."
27,2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","It is a serious problem that there is an inadequate number of students who tend to select science as their major subject in universities in many countries. In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.
The main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.
This trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. If there are not enough scientists, the whole scientific ability will decrease. Not only will the government pay extra money to other foreign countries to buy the required technology such as military equipment, but the public needs to spend more time and pay more effort to maintain the international standard production rate of a country. It is extremely dangerous that a nation easily suffers from a financial crisis and, finally, it influences the living standard of its citizens and causes damage to its financial systems.
In summary, while science is regarded as a ""useless"" subject because of its narrow career path and low success rate, it is vital that the economic systems would be affected if a country develop without scientists.",,,,,,7.0,"In recent years, it has become a noticeable concern that not enough students are selecting science subjects at the university level in many parts of the world. One major reason for this is that students feel science degrees are both challenging and lengthy, with limited job opportunities compared to fields like business, law, or information technology. Often, science courses require many years of study and are perceived as difficult, which can discourage students who are searching for degrees with more direct or flexible career paths. Additionally, popular media and society sometimes fail to highlight the importance and success of scientific careers, making them seem less attractive to new graduates who are also worried about financial stability. The social effects of this decline in science students can be severe. When fewer individuals study science, a country might lag behind in research, innovation, and technological development. This situation can lead to increased dependence on other nations for scientific knowledge and technology, which harms economic independence and growth. Furthermore, innovation in essential areas such as healthcare, energy, and environmental protection can be stunted, affecting the overall quality of life for the population. In conclusion, while students may avoid science due to perceived difficulties and uncertain job prospects, the long-term negative effects on society’s development and independence can be significant and far-reaching."
29,2,"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?","In recent time, it is observed that the number of students enrolling for Science or Mathematics in higher education is decreasing all over the world. There are plenty of reasons that are causing this decline which will affect the society negatively. In this essay, I will discuss why the number of pupils is deacreasing who prefer science stream and what will be the impacts on a community if it continues.
The main reason of this situation is lack of trained science and mathematics teachers. STEM teachers are not able to kindle the joy of learning among students. If students do not get proper foundation and motivation in their school life to pursue STEM subjects, they will develop Math or Science phobia. Subsequently, they will rather prefer other streams to complete their higher education.
Eventually, this situation will impact the scociety in many ways. Firstly, there would be scarcity of doctors all over the world which will affect health sector dramatically. Eventually, people will suffer with many health problems. Secondly, if students do not take STEM subjects in university, there will not be STEM teachers to teach future generation. According to me, government must take firm steps to avoid these situations in future. There must be some training program to keep STEM teachers up to date to enhance their teaching. This will enable teachers to make science subjects enjoyable for students, for instance, teachers may incorporate technology in the learning process.
To conclude, I believe that government and teachers should take the resposibility to create the conducive environment to learn these subjects in fun way. This will, eventually, increase the number of students enrolling for STEM subjects in recent future. Otherwise, it may have negative impacts on society which will not be a good sign for any country.",,,,,,7.0,"In many parts of the world, fewer students are choosing to study science at university, and this trend can be traced back to several essential factors, each with substantial potential consequences for society. One major reason is that science subjects are widely perceived as more challenging and demanding than other areas of study; as a result, many students feel intimidated and opt for fields that seem easier or offer quicker job opportunities. Furthermore, careers in science sometimes require more years of education and may not offer immediate financial rewards, which can discourage students who are concerned about job security and income. Another contributing factor may be the way science is taught in schools; a lack of engaging, hands-on experiences can make the subject seem abstract or irrelevant to everyday life. As fewer students choose science, society may face a shortage of qualified professionals such as engineers, researchers, and medical workers, potentially stalling technological advancements and slowing economic growth. This decline could also mean fewer innovators working to solve critical problems like climate change or disease. To counteract these issues, it is essential for governments and educators to invest in improving science education, make careers in science more appealing, and highlight their importance for the future of society."
31,2,The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"These days it is firmly believed that the most efficient method to teach children in schools how to work together is through team sports. This essay disagrees with the statement since some young students might not enjoy playing sports and because team sports can raise competitiveness amongst children, hence having a negative impact on their friendly relationships.
First of all, although it is vital for a children to play sports and keep fit, not everyone is keen on football, rugby and volleyball. Instead, some young students prefer spending their leisure time on other activities such as joining a chorus group or teathre lessons. These activities can encourage cooperation and make children get along with each other, as well. On the other hand, forcing children to play something they doesn't feel comfortable in can make them withdraw from the team game, which would make them feel excluded.
In addition, teams sports do not always promote cooperation among players. In some cases, inequities or particularly ambitious behaviours can lead to violent competitiveness, instead. It is generally thought that sport is an extremely selective environment, in fact you need to exercise daily in order to keep fit. If obese children took part in those team sports as well, they could feel isolated because they do not own the perfect body to perform well.
In conclusion, although team sports are a great method to teach children how to get along with each other, there are various activities which can encourage cooperation among children, as well. Therefore, it is considerably significant for a school to embrace diversity and make children play with what they really like, instead of forcing them to do something they feel they don't belong.",,,,,,8.0,"While it is often claimed that encouraging children to participate in team sports is the most effective way to foster their sense of cooperation, I do not fully agree with this idea. One reason is that team sports are not universally appealing; many students may dislike physical games or feel anxious about performing in front of others, which could cause them to withdraw rather than engage with their classmates. Furthermore, team sports sometimes promote rivalry and exclude those who are less athletically skilled, making these children feel left out and lowering their self-esteem. Alternatively, activities such as group projects in academic subjects, art clubs, or playing in a school band can also teach students how to work together and appreciate each other's strengths without placing emphasis on physical ability. In these settings, children can still learn to listen to others, share responsibilities, and achieve common goals. To conclude, while team sports can be useful in teaching cooperation, a variety of inclusive activities should be offered so every child can find a way to collaborate comfortably and confidently."
33,2,The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There's an opinion around the ideal way to encourage and teach youngesters how to develop cooperetion skills and that is through team sports at educational facilities. I completly agree with that opinion and this essay shall demonstrate some vital reasons to support my view.
A very important reason is that engrossing with teammates will naturally result in the evolvment in the infant's cooperation and cognitive skills. through sociallizing with other same-aged people, the child meets new children and encounter certain events that will make them acuire skillfulness regarding cooperation. For instance, some parts of the world pour their focus on including activities, in a context of teamwork, in the school curriculum due to the knowledgable fact that working as a group for the child not only it devolops teamwork skills but also the cognitive ones.
Experiencing failure and win will teach the offspring how to encourage their peers when they feel demotivated in order to reach a mutual goal, also how to share and demonstrate their appreciation in terms of winning a comptetion. I have obsorved my little brother when he plays in groups, noticeablly, he gets more motivated and happier when he wins alongside his team because he can express his gratitude and show sence of appreciation to his peers wich means he now developed coopreation skills.
In conclusion, despite the fact that involving in teamwork kind of activity will yield the advancement regarding cooperation and cognitive skills for youngesters, also encountering the results of a competition, whether it was failure or winning, will inevitably make them acuire skills to deal with such events that evenually make them better cooperatives.",,,,,,5.0,"There is a widespread belief that participating in team sports at school is the most effective strategy for teaching children how to cooperate. I largely agree with this perspective and will explain my reasons for holding this opinion. Primarily, team sports present numerous opportunities for youngsters to work together toward a shared objective, which is essential for nurturing cooperation. When children play sports like soccer or basketball, they must learn to pass the ball, communicate on the field, and depend on each other’s strengths, all of which directly build cooperative abilities. Furthermore, the environment of team sports goes beyond just physical activity; children are continually exposed to situations where sharing, compromise, and mutual support are needed. For example, when losing a game, students must encourage each other rather than blaming anyone, supporting the development of empathy and understanding. From my own observation, my cousin has significantly improved his ability to work with others after joining his school’s volleyball team, as he now listens more attentively to his classmates and appreciates group achievements. In conclusion, while other activities may also teach cooperation, team sports offer a unique and practical setting that allows children to naturally develop these skills through real-life experiences and collective goal-setting, which is instrumental to their growth."
35,2,The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people believe that the most effective way to teach children cooperation in teamwork is by encouraging them to join team sports at school. I completely agree with this idea and will give my reasons as follows.
Firstly, team sports require children to work together and practice communication in order to achieve a common goal. For example, in Taiwan, many schools have baseball lessons in sports courses, and some schools even have a school baseball team. In such courses, children can learn to trust one another and develop communication skills by playing. Furthermore, they can develop mutual understanding and compromise with their teammates in order to reach a common goal. In this way, they can develop their social skills, find a way to cooperate, and build positive relationships with their peers. As a result, team sports experiences will contribute to their social skills and social life as well.
Secondly, team sports can teach children the value of perseverance and resilience. Through the experience of competing with other teams, children can learn to accept the ups and downs of success and defeat and go through any difficult situations with their teammates. This is especially the case if they fail in a competition as they can learn to encourage each other and develop a sense of group belonging. For instance, we can see many touching stories in team competitions where despite being on the losing side at the beginning, the team rallies, and members encourage each other to restart. This can be a great lesson for children to build their resilience, self-confidence, and a sense of belonging, as well as develop a positive attitude toward their life in the future.
In conclusion, I believe that team sports provide children with opportunities to develop their social skills, increase their confidence and resilience, and ultimately benefit their whole life. Therefore, they should be included in the school curriculum for children.",,,,,,9.0,"Some people believe that the best way to teach children how to cooperate is by having them participate in team sports at school, and I largely agree with this perspective. To begin with, team sports naturally encourage children to collaborate in order to win a game or achieve a shared objective, which is an essential part of learning cooperation. For example, when students play basketball or soccer, they must learn to communicate clearly, share responsibilities, and support each other both on and off the field. This group dynamic provides children with a real-life environment where they experience firsthand the importance of working together. Additionally, team sports help children understand the value of compromise and respecting different viewpoints since every teammate might have their own approach to solving problems during the game. Beyond just learning to cooperate, children also develop other valuable social skills, such as patience and empathy, as they deal with both triumph and defeat alongside their peers. For instance, after losing a match, students often come together, support each other, and discuss how they can improve, which strengthens their bonds and teaches them the importance of collective effort. In summary, I believe that team sports play a significant role in teaching children how to cooperate, along with many other life skills, and thus should be considered a central part of school education."
37,2,The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The ability to associate at school has been a great concern. Owing to this, some assume that the optimal way to boost children's collaborative spirit is through school team sports. In my opinion, teaming up in school sports would be problematic, and therefore, should be implemented in certain occasions, with certain individuals.
Initially, participating in team sports would put a tremendous risk in injuries. Inevitably, physical group activities require high-speed movements, resulting in harsh collisions. Students then may lose their interest in those activities, or hesitate to attend in order to avoid any kind of damage to their body.
Another point to consider is that joining team sports can effortlessly breed serious competition among teammates. Therefore, at that time, the objective of cultivating cooperation would be replaced by the desire for accolades in children's mind. This consequently spells trouble for the hostile environment as the feeling of inadequacy and low sellf-esteem in students are growing.
Finally, the best solution would be offering team sports as an optional project for students. To illustrate, a school football match can open more opportunities for those into soccer and accept to play in unity. In this case, participants may have a chance to immerse themselves in a joint effort after being thoroughly disseminated about the rules. As a result, they are still able to enjoy the game while working in a joint project.
In conclusion, boosting children association by teamsports may not be feasible for all of them, but operating more joint projects for those with passion and fair play is a much better approach.",,,,,,7.5,"While many believe that the most effective method to foster cooperation among children is through participating in team sports at school, I am not completely convinced that this is the only or best approach. Firstly, although team sports do offer chances for students to work together towards a common goal, they can also promote unhealthy rivalry or exclude those who are less physically inclined. This exclusion might hinder some children from developing cooperative skills, as they may feel marginalized or discouraged. Furthermore, the focus on winning often overshadows the initial aim of teamwork, sometimes resulting in arguments or resentment between teammates instead of unity. Meanwhile, other school activities, such as group projects in the classroom or art clubs, also offer valuable opportunities for collaboration while reducing the likelihood of competition or injury. For these reasons, I believe that while team sports can be one useful tool for teaching cooperation, schools should provide a variety of group activities and allow children to choose those that best suit their interests and abilities. Ultimately, a diverse approach will enable more students to cultivate true cooperative skills in a supportive environment."
39,2,The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is currently a contentious argument that the most effective method for young people to learn about cooperation is by doing team sports, rather than other alternatives. Despite the fact that doing sports as a team could inarguably strengthen collaboration skills of children, I personally believe that there are also other vital ways to upskill them in this aspect.
It is true that doing team sports could possibly lead to the collaboration of children. A classic example of this is that they have to jointly cooperate with other team members in order to achieve the team’s goal. This is because reaching the goal in team sports requires each member to not only do their responsibility, but also to help other members to maximize the performance of the team. In addition, supporters of doing team sports may argue that children will also learn to communicate with other members, which is one of key factors for cooperation. As a result, when young people have better communication skills, they tend to be willing to collaborate with other people in any situation.
In spite of the aforementioned positive effects on juveniles with respect to the cooperation, the juveniles could also be encouraged to cooperate by working in a group as another alternative way. A common example of this is they have to think from other perspectives, which is an essential skill for collaboration. When juveniles work with other people, they would inevitably encounter with a wide variety of ideas which they might disagree with. Therefore, they have to understand the ideas from the others’ point of view in order to reach a consensus. Furthermore, another key point for cooperation that adolescents will learn is delegation. This is because tasks that a group has to complete might requires various knowledge. Hence, adolescents have to delegate each task to each group member based on the expertise.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that doing team sport will positively result in the collaboration of children since they would get exposed to situations, requiring them to help and communicate with other team members. Nevertheless, I totally disagree with the notion that team sport is the best way to teach children to collaborate since doing assignment in a group could also teach and motivate them to cooperate with other people in terms of thinking from other points of view and work delegation.",,,,,,8.0,"It is often debated whether participating in team sports at school is the most effective means of teaching children about cooperation, or if other opportunities are equally valuable. While it is undeniable that team sports present children with numerous scenarios to practice cooperation towards a shared objective, I believe that other educational activities are just as essential in developing collaboration skills. Sports undeniably require children to communicate, support their teammates, and work together to succeed against their opponents; these are fundamental aspects of cooperation. For instance, players must listen to instructions, provide encouragement, and fulfill specific roles on the field, which naturally fosters a sense of unity and collective responsibility. However, activities such as working on group projects in the classroom or participating in drama productions can also cultivate similar abilities. When students engage in collaborative academic work, they often encounter diverse points of view, must compromise, and learn to resolve conflicts peacefully, all of which are critical components of cooperation in broader society. Additionally, non-sport opportunities are inclusive for those children who may not enjoy or be able to participate in athletic activities. In summary, although team sports at school are certainly advantageous for instilling cooperation, I disagree with the view that they are the single best way; a well-rounded educational environment, offering a range of collaborative tasks, is likely the most effective approach."

However, it should also be recognized that not all children are interested in or physically able to participate in sports, and some may even feel left out or anxious when forced to join. For such students, other group activities including art projects, drama, or group assignments in the classroom can also teach cooperation effectively.

However, it would be wrong to assume that only team sports can teach such lessons.

45,2,"While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?","Whether people should be encouraged more to study vocational courses due to the lack of workforce in that area or be encouraged to study at the university remains a big discussion. I believe both of these areas of study should be promoted equally, countries need academics as well as qualified workers.
One of the reasons that supports the encouragement to study either area, academic or vocational, is the worldwide need for the two types of professionals. For example, Australian government is currently offering work visas and permanent residencies to overseas qualified workers such as, carpenters, cooks, bar managers as well as doctors, nurses and psychologists. Essentially, this demonstrates that the two areas are equally needed and this happens in Canada and England too.
Another point to be considered is the increase in the people's needs due to the population growth, which, therefore, affects the need for more experts in all sectors. This includes professional from different fields, such as science, construction and even thinkers. If people is encouraged to study more in one field than others, this might be detrimental to societies, leaving one sector significantly more affected. Eventually, countries need a balance in the areas choosen for people to growth a career.
In conclusion, I support the idea of encouraging both, university and vocational studies. Many countries worldwide have expressed their need for the two types of workers. Besides, as the population is rapidly increasing, the need for experts in multiples areas is increasing too, so promoting both is the only way to maintain a balance.",,,,,,7.5,"There is an ongoing debate about whether more people should pursue university degrees or if greater emphasis should be placed on vocational training, particularly due to shortages in trades such as electricians and plumbers. While it is true that qualified tradespeople are in high demand, I believe that both university education and vocational training deserve equal encouragement. Society relies on a diverse range of skills, from academic researchers to skilled trades workers, and prioritizing one over the other could harm economic and social development. For instance, medical advances and technological innovation stem from academic institutions, yet homes and businesses could not function without skilled electricians and plumbers. Additionally, as populations grow and economies evolve, the demand for both intellectual and practical expertise expands. Limiting encouragement to vocational training alone may solve short-term shortages but could leave gaps in areas where academic knowledge is crucial. Therefore, a balanced approach, where individuals are supported and guided based on their abilities and interests, would best serve the needs of a well-rounded, functioning society."
47,2,"While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?","Some believe that people should be encouraged more to study practical courses than going to university to fulfill the lack of workforce in practical areas. I agree with this proposal to some degree, because, from my knowledge, there is a lack in both fields, academic and vocational experts. Moreover, academic studies and vocational ones are equally important for every society, and not everybody can study the same thing, so both studies should be encouraged.
Qualified workers and professional academics are equally needed in many parts of the world. This is because as the population grows the people's needs do it too, and this happens in all shapes and areas. While living in Argentina, I noticed the need of professionals in fields such as medicine and technology, especially robotics. In England, however, I observed the lack of plumers and carpenters. Consequently, every country needs different things.
Furthermore, if strong encouragement is put on studying vocational courses only, this could be detrimental to the academic field. Essentially, both study systems are equally important. A hospital needs doctors to treat people as well as electricians to maintain the building. Besides, not everybody is good at everything. Some might be good at performing practical tasks and some good at thinking. In my family, I am the one who studied at the university, but my sister studied dressmaking. Both of us have jobs nowadays.
In conclusion, I believe that the two types of studies should be stimulated. Countries worldwide are in lack of different experts, either in the vocational or academic field, hence, both workers are equally essential and needed. Besides and more importantly, not every individual can study the same subject or perform in the same area.",,,,,,6.5,"It is commonly suggested that more people should pursue vocational training instead of university education to address shortages in professions like plumbing and electrical work. While I understand this reasoning, I only partially agree with the idea that vocational training should be prioritized over academic study. In modern societies, both university graduates and skilled tradespeople are essential, as each group fulfills important roles. For example, when I lived in a city where many people attended university, there were still not enough trained mechanics or technicians available, causing delays and frustration for everyday repairs. However, in rural areas, the lack of doctors or engineers often posed bigger problems. Encouraging more young people to enter vocational fields would help fill many current gaps in the workforce, but it is also crucial to maintain support for academic studies, since we also need teachers, scientists, and business leaders. Each individual has unique interests and skills, and society benefits when people pursue careers suited to their strengths rather than following a single path. Ultimately, a balanced approach that values both vocational and academic education is necessary to ensure that all areas of society function well and that people find fulfilling work."
49,2,"While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?","In today's era, most students look forward to enrolling in professional courses at universities. However, some believe that authorities should encourage teenagers to take vocational courses as there is a huge shortage of professionals like electricians and plumbers. In my opinion, while there is a scarcity of such workers and the government should make special arrangements for prospective learners, certain other factors should also be considered.
Due to the insufficient work possibilities after completing vocational courses and extremely low wages, scholars are forced to take loans at high interest from banks to attend university programmes. An average adult has to pay more than 70,000 USD yearly for a typical professional course at a university, and most children are unable to accumulate sufficient funds in time, which forces them to borrow this amount from banks. The job market for plumbing and electrical work is highly unregulated, which leads to the exploitation of such workers by the established brands, further distressing the people. Some regulations should be established for these markets to decrease the risk factor for workers.
On the other hand, due to the continuing increase in our population, the demand for doctors, engineers, and professors is also rising. In recent years, governments from all over the world have reported the widening gap between the number of professionals available per 1000 people. For example, in India, there is only 1 doctor available per 50 people in urban areas, and the number is even more concerning in rural areas, where the figure of patients climbs even further.
In my opinion, authorities and universities should work together towards introducing scholarships and other benefits not only for learners of professional courses but also for peoples of vocational courses. Furthermore, better and more wages for plumbers and electricians could also be established to attract more students.
In conclusion, favourable policies should be implemented for qualified workers to attract more potential learners by the government, as well as lower tution fees for university attendees.",,,,,,9.0,"There is no doubt that vocational training plays a crucial role in any society, as skilled workers like electricians and plumbers are essential for daily life. While many people encourage university education to gain academic knowledge and prestigious degrees, it is equally important to recognize the value of hands-on professions, which are often overlooked. I agree that more young people should be encouraged to pursue vocational training because the demand for skilled tradespeople remains consistently high. At present, there is a clear shortage of qualified workers in trades, leading to longer waiting periods for repairs and increased costs for these services. Additionally, vocational careers can provide stable incomes, job security, and opportunities for entrepreneurship, especially as university graduates increasingly struggle to find jobs in their chosen fields. However, it is necessary to invest in improving the reputation and quality of vocational programs so students view them as advantageous rather than a second choice. At the same time, society still requires university-trained professionals such as doctors and teachers. Ideally, both paths should be equally respected and supported, so students can freely select what best suits their abilities and interests. Overall, encouraging more vocational training would benefit communities by addressing labor shortages, supporting local economies, and creating a more balanced workforce."

Do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, with the development of education, more and more students go to colleges for academic learning. However, some people consider that we should provide more vocational courses because a lack of practical workers such as electricians and plumbers. Personally, I think academic study is obviously important bacause it can improve the technology and the misunderstanding of job-not the lack of vocational training- is the main reason for a lack of labored workers.
It is no doubt that the academic learning in university can induct the practical training and provoke the development of technology in different areas such as agricuture. If we deeply understand the theory of academic knowledge and reasonablely apply them in different fields, we could efficiently improve the technology and help human beings to increase their living standard. For instance, the development of drones turly improve the quantity of crops, which is benifit for famers. However, this technology need a lot of basic theories to invent the drones and teach worker to handle this machine. At this time, the academic study becomes much more important for practical workers.
Some people claim that it is because a lack of vocational training, thus leading to a lack of qualified worker. However, in my opinion, I think there are mainly two reasons come from the misunderstanding of jod cause this bad situation. For one aspect, some people think that practical workers usually cannot earn much more money compared to empolyees working in office. Thus, they just give up this occupation for their career. For another aspect, some people do not respect those qualified worker, which make them feel their job are secondary. At last, there are no more people would like to choose this type of works.
In conclusion, I think academic study is very much important for students to improve the technology, and the lack of practical workers is not because of less provided vocational training, but the misunderstanding of job between some people.",,,,,,6.0,"In recent years, the number of students attending university for academic study has greatly increased, but there is a growing discussion about whether more people should be encouraged to pursue vocational training instead. Some people believe that the shortage of skilled workers such as electricians and plumbers is due to too few vocational training opportunities, and I mostly agree with this view. Vocational training provides essential hands-on skills that are directly related to many jobs that are always needed in society. For example, plumbers and electricians are necessary to build and maintain safe and functional buildings, yet these professions often face shortages simply because not enough young people choose to learn these trades. While university education is important to drive innovation and research, not every person’s talents or ambitions fit the same academic pathway, and for some, practical training can actually offer faster job entry and higher salaries. Additionally, if society start to encourage vocational training more openly and respect these careers, the perception of such work might improve, attracting more people to these crucial roles. Therefore, expanding and promoting vocational training is an effective solution to the current lack of qualified workers, and it can benefit both individuals and society as a whole."
53,2,"Some people think that governments should ban dangerous sports, while others think people should have freedom to do any sports or activity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion","According to some people administration should stop the sports that are risky, while few others have an opinion that individuals should have liberty to perform any kind of sports or activity. In my opinion critical sports should be stopped because it not only dangerous but harmful for others as it attracts youngesters.
Firstly, the sports activities which are risky, should be banned by the government as, they are the only ones who can actually stop this life taking so called adventure and put a full stop. Infact, people specially youngsters get affected as they get easily influenced and under peer pressure perform these tasks without any guidance or safety, for instance, road racing which is the major cause for accidents in many countries which not only effect them but the public arround, another example is Death's well where car drivers drive the car in a well in circular motion where their is no guarantee of life where at any moment people can die.
Secondly, everyone should have right to perform sports or activities according to their taste, however, safety is the primary concern that one should keep in mind. while stopping all the ones which can actually take a life should not be performed.
As a result, these dangerous events has various outcomes majority of the performers turnout to be handicapped or with broken bones. so guidelines and measures taken by government is necessary.
In conculsion, the risky sports activities should banned and government should only allow the events with keeping the risk in mind and the after effects of the activity that what influence will it have on people of diiferent age criteria.",,,,,,7.0,"Some people argue that authorities ought to prohibit sports that involve serious risks, whereas others believe that everyone should have the right to participate in any sport or activity of their preference. Supporters of banning dangerous sports claim that it is a government's duty to protect its citizens, especially when some activities can lead to serious injuries or even fatalities, such as base jumping or illegal street racing. They worry that thrill-seeking, particularly among teenagers and young adults, often leads to unnecessary tragedies, which could be prevented through strict regulations. On the other hand, many individuals insist that personal freedom is vital, and people should be responsible for their own choices, as long as they are aware of the hazards and take appropriate safety measures. For example, sports like rock climbing or skydiving, while dangerous, can be practiced with professional equipment and supervision to lower the risk. In my opinion, rather than completely banning such sports, it is better for governments to ensure strong safety standards and strict rules, so that people can enjoy their chosen activities while minimizing harm to themselves and others. Ultimately, a balance should be maintained between public safety and personal liberty."

Owning to this, some assume that the Governments should abolish this type of sports while others contend that citizens should have a right to immerse in any activities, regardless of its high-risk characteristics. In my opinion, the policies ought to focus on participants's assurance instead of banning any sports.
On the one hand, the propose of prohibiting extreme sports should not be approved because it is against the democratic society. Inevitably, the participating in risky sports is one of residents' rights. As a result, the intervention of the Admistrations in this case will prevent them from their own interests illegally. Moreover, the extreme sports abolishment may extinguish carreers and dreams of numerous professional athletes and trainees. Therefore, banning is not a reasonable approach in this situation.
On the other hand, authorizing freedom in playing dangerous sports generates several matters. Understandably, participants mostly risk their health and lives being involved in these activities, from violence and physical injuries, which means the furious characteristics are posing a threat to their own existences. In addition, the prohibition on those sports can orientate hobby development for future generation on healthy sports, requiring less violence and intension. This, therefore, leads to a more tranquil community.
Finally, according to my perspective, the Administrations should attempt to handle safety assurance and enhance risk education in those players. Under this circumstance, the residents are equipped with protective support and still allowed to enjoy and follow their passion. This then would be the optimal way to meet residents' demand.
Conclusively, I personally believe the solution is not about whether the Governments should forbid furious sports activities, but about providing them protective assurance and risk acknowledgement.",,,,,,5.5,"The debate over whether governments should prohibit dangerous sports is ongoing, as some argue for public safety while others advocate for personal freedom. On one side, those who support a ban believe that hazardous sports can lead to serious injuries or even death, which can put unnecessary strain on healthcare systems and set a bad example for young people. Furthermore, they argue that by banning these sports, governments can reduce the risk of avoidable accidents and promote safer forms of recreation. Conversely, others insist that individuals should be free to choose how they spend their time, even if there is an element of risk. They claim that participating in extreme sports can be thrilling and rewarding, helping people develop courage, discipline, and resilience. In addition, many athletes rely on these sports for their careers, and a ban could negatively impact their livelihoods. In my view, rather than imposing bans, governments should introduce strict safety regulations and provide education about the risks involved.

I am in two minds on this, but probably governments should take care of their citizens and be responsible for human lives.
Firstly, extrem sports are very popular above young generation in all over the world and these kinds of activity are the huge part of pastime for thousands people. Risk's lovers spend planty of time and enormous amount of money to feel freadom and to try themselfs as a brave and strong persons. For instance, in my country such sports as rock jumping, mountain cyicling and BMX are very popular. And even if these activites are dangerous, young men and women are keen on it, and they are against the governments who wants to ban this sports.
On the other hand, adult people always want to protect younger ones. To my point of thinking protection is significant habbit of human beings that we need to respect. However, governments, who try to ban dangerous sports, need to be more flexible, and not only say no for harmful sports, but involve young generation in activites that are not so risky. I also belive that media attention can make seance about all cons of extrem choice, becouse information about number of death between exrem sportmens can be helpful.

Conversely, others argue that people have the right to make their own choices, including taking risks for excitement, personal growth, or to challenge themselves. Many see extreme sports as a way to express freedom or overcome fears, and they believe that restrictions would infringe on individual rights.

63,2,"Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In developed country, economic wealth is not an issue for them. Some people argue that more growth in economics won't provide additional satisfaction to its citizens. I partially agree with this viewpoint that any additional economical growth will have a diminishing returns in developed country. However money is still the driving force to well-beings.
The statisfaction level of the citizens in developed country is driven by many factors. Economical stability is of course a very important one to consider. However, there are other factors such as health care systems, education systems, and enviormental protections. These are also equally important to the financial stability of one country. Degree of satisfaction for citizens should be measured in many aspects.
On the other hand, economic wealth is the main fundemental to reach beyond just putting food on the tables. For government, any additional wealth can be utlized to slove potential social problems. For examble, there is always money needed to funding hospitals for better health care. Secondly, additioanl wealth can also be used for protection of the country against terriosts attack and war prevention. The military force needs ongoing funding to promote stability and order in the world for developed country. Thirdly, more wealth can be used to develop new technology to better our daily lives. If we need a new breakthrough in high tech industry, government needs more financial support to help scientists doing reseach and development.
In conclusion, I believe the satisfaction of citizens in developed country can always be better off with additional wealth.",,,,,,5.5,"It is often believed that once a country is rich enough, further increases in wealth stop making people happier. I mostly agree with this idea because after reaching a certain standard of living, people start to value other aspects of life more than just money. In wealthy countries, basic needs such as food, shelter, and health care are already available to almost everyone, so additional income might not create a significant change in day-to-day satisfaction. Factors like work-life balance, quality of relationships, and environmental cleanliness may have a stronger impact on people’s happiness than a growing economy. Yet, it cannot be denied that new wealth can be used by the government to improve public facilities and invest in science or culture, which may bring indirect benefits to citizens. Still, the effect of money on personal satisfaction decreases as a country gets richer, since people’s expectations and desires grow as well, making it harder to gain extra happiness simply from economic growth. Therefore, I think that while wealth remains important, its power to improve life satisfaction is much weaker in already prosperous countries."

While it is a commonly held belief that the rich countries are try to increase it's economic wealth have become not satisfing to citixens anymore.
There is also an argument that raising the country economic has more advantages than disadvantages.
In my opinion, I consider that the countries must always have plans to increase their income whether they were rich or not.
Another point to consider, growing the country economic may help in future or to be saved to emergency situations.
Moreover, expansion of economics income could not make the people satisfied but in other hand may be used in increase the luxury life.
In other word, it is also possible to say that icreasing the wealth almost has no disadvantages to the country neither the citizens.",,,,,,3.5,"It is often argued that when a country already enjoys a high level of wealth, further increases in economic riches do not necessarily make its people happier. Some believe that once basic needs are met, additional money brings little benefit to overall satisfaction. However, others feel that continuously improving the economy brings new opportunities and security for everyone. In my view, I think it is important for even rich countries to seek greater economic growth, because it can support improvements in healthcare and education, as well as prepare the country for unexpected difficulties. While it is true that more wealth might not always make citizens feel happier, especially if their basic needs are already covered, having a stronger economy can help reduce problems like unemployment or inequality. Therefore, even if the satisfaction of citizens does not automatically grow with more wealth, I believe it is worthwhile for countries to continue developing their economies so that everyone can benefit in different ways."

In this essay, I disagree that lucrative wealth makes citizens careless about anything because they are developing their country. Additionally, I will talk about how economic wealth had changed the life of people in their countires. There are numerous reasons why economic wealth is prominent even though if the country is rich they could be richer.
Firstly, the higher the remunerative wealth makes life easy for citizens. Because now it is difficult to find jobs, therefore, these profitable companies could afford you one in your rich country. Some people may believe that people would be careless, that is not true. Because people are the main purposes of making this wealth, and they also want to develop their country and make it more knownable for the rest of life. Moreover, living in a rich country gives a priority for a good life.
Furthermore, the increase of economic wealth changes the view of other countires and citizens. Having a high economic wealth could change the life of people. All of the people are greedy no matter what you do they want more and more, therefore, people are developing their county to have a high salary and live a tranquil life.
To conclude, having an increase of economic wealth in a country changes the lives of citizens. People are trying to develop the countries to make it more knownable and a prominent figure in life. Meanwhile, people are greedy they want more that what they deserve so by the increase of lurcative wealth they could get higher than what they deserve.",,,,,,5.0,"Many specialists argue that once a nation is already prosperous, any further growth in wealth does not truly improve the happiness of its people. Personally, I do not completely agree with this because even in wealthy countries, economic progress can continue to benefit citizens’ lives, both directly and indirectly. When economies expand, governments may invest more in public services, healthcare, and education, which can enhance the quality of life for everyone, not just the wealthy. Additionally, new economic opportunities can help to reduce unemployment and provide citizens with better jobs. Although some believe that endless wealth cannot fulfill emotional satisfaction, money can solve many practical problems and bring security. Furthermore, the progress of a country can bring a sense of national pride and inspire people to contribute more to their society.

First of all, the public social services will be improved.This is due tho the reason that the government is not limited to its economic resources.For example when the government want to construct new road of any distance kilometers,it will construct within a given period of time
Another reason is based on how people are willing to pay taxes. In any developed country, people are likely to pay taxes willingly.Forexample when a company generate its revenue for more than 100%, its capable to pay the taxes and pay its employee high salary and sweet bonus.This leads to satification of citizens.
Addition to that, is ability for the high and middle economy class citizens to provide support or donations to poor or low level economy class citizens.This is due to the fact that rich people are often likely to provide to bread to the poor one.
In conclution, its obvious the fact that addition economy in the developed country is not the only factor to make its people satisfiable.There are number of factor including political stability, good government leadership but few to mention.However in my opinion i believe additional economy in economically giant country dramatically contribute to satification of majority of citizens.",,,,,,6.0,"Some people think that when a country is already wealthy, gaining more money does not make the people happier. However, I do not fully agree with this idea. When a rich country gets even more economic growth, there are still many ways this can help citizens live better. Firstly, more money can be spent on healthcare, schools, and other important services. This means people can get better hospitals and children can have better teachers, which makes life more comfortable and less stressful. Secondly, increased national wealth can help create more jobs or increase salaries, making it possible for people to buy what they need and enjoy their lives. Also, as the country grows richer, it can give more help to poor people or invest in new technology like public transport and clean energy, which benefits everyone. In conclusion, I believe that even in countries that are already rich, earning more money can still make a big difference in people’s satisfaction, especially if it is used in the right ways.

From my point of view, I completely disagree this opinion.
Firstly, there still has a gap between rich and poor people in the reach country. As the economic situation of a country is getting better and better, it is true that most of the people would like to believe that all the residents will live a happy ever life. But still, there must be some people struggle to manage their life. Take China as an example, the GDP of China saw a dramatic increase in the recent years, people in the mega cities or the first level cities like Beijing and Shanghai do not worry about their food anymore, and can enjoy their high quality life. However, there still has some poor citizens who live in the small city and trying their best to feed their children. These poor people may not earn enough salaries or lost their job, thus, any addiction increase in economic wealth may be an opportunity for them, which can makes them feel satisfied enough.
Secondly, the growth in economic will make residents richer than before. People are living in the material world, no one will refuse the economic wealth to make their life better. A rich country means most of the residents in this country is middle or above middle class, an increase in the economic wealth means they can get a better house, send their children to a better school, spend more time on leisure activity instead of working, for all these benefits that the economic growth bring to them, they would fell satisfied.

In my view, I do not agree with this opinion. To begin with, even in countries that are considered rich, not everyone enjoys the same standard of living. There are always people who face unemployment, high living costs, or struggle with housing and healthcare. For instance, in the United States, which has a strong economy, many families still have trouble paying for medical bills or finding affordable education. If economic growth continues and wealth is used to improve social welfare or increase employment, these citizens are likely to feel more satisfied with their lives. Additionally, extra economic wealth can help improve infrastructure, public services, and environmental protection. When subway systems are expanded or air pollution is reduced, everyone benefits, leading to higher satisfaction in society. Finally, people naturally desire a better quality of life, and economic growth can provide new opportunities for travel, entertainment, and innovation.

It is true that in countries like Norway, Canada, or Germany, the basic needs of the population are usually fulfilled, with widespread access to health care, education, and employment. For this reason, an extra rise in economic figures may not create a massive difference in everyday satisfaction, because people already have a comfortable lifestyle. However, economic growth can still improve the quality of public services, make advanced technology more available, and allow governments to reduce taxes or invest in important projects, which can make life better for everyone. On the other hand, if additional wealth is only concentrated in the hands of a few, or if there are growing inequalities, then most citizens might not feel any more satisfied, or might even feel worse. To summarize, while further economic growth in rich nations does not always guarantee greater satisfaction, it has the potential to benefit people if it is managed fairly and used to improve society as a whole."

In terms of problems, the most population in rich country, They not feel to under them which income in their country. The main reason given to support this claim is that they usually comfortable life and request additional, subsequently they not engurage to support the limit people income. To illustrate, In Japan the population most of them is selfish, They not donate or help the limit people income. In other words the rich countries when additional increase in economy is become negative things.
However, The some rich countries is support young people and donate to poor countries. Firstly, UK is support its population in terms of sports. In other words they built several sport facilities to support official clubs and public people. For instance, Football fields in public places, which the more people saves their health. Secondly, In France it has some factories for make the cars, And bring students from the cars college to the factories because take experience before graduation. Also, some of the young people they has unique hobby, subsequently rich country it can spent money to support talent young.
In conclusion, although the rich countries when received any additional to increase economy dose not make any more satisfied. Therefore, I believe that increase in economy in rich countries it is necessary to developed the country and their different population.",,,,,,5.0,"These days, many people discuss about how rich countries should use their wealth to increase satisfaction in the population. Some experts think that once a country is wealthy enough, any more money will not make people happier. In my opinion, I agree to some extent, but there are also reasons why more economic wealth can still have a positive effect. On one hand, I think it is true that when basic needs are met, extra money does not always turn into more happiness. This is because citizens already have good housing, health care, and education, so extra money might not make a big impact on their daily life. On the other hand, I think a country can use extra wealth in new ways, like improving public transportation, investing in green energy, or supporting art and culture. For example, countries like Sweden and Norway use their wealth to provide better services and a cleaner environment, which can make people more satisfied. To sum up, I think increasing wealth in rich countries does not always mean people will be more satisfied, but if the money is spent in creative or helpful ways, it can still bring benefits to the citizens."

Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"An increasing number of individuals are taking the decision to have cosmetic surgery in order to achieve a better appearance. I strongly believe that mass media advertising and lower costs of surgery are the reasons for the above. Likewise, I think that it is a negative development for our society.
To begin with, it is very well known that mass media advertising and lower costs of surgery affect the behaviour of the citizens. Mass media advertising is promoting an uncommon archetype among the population. Plenty of men and women feel that they do not have sex appeal due to the fact that their bodies are different to those shown on television. Moreover, cosmetic surgery costs are more affordable nowadays than before. Hence, several women receive cosmetic surgery as a birthday gift.
Additionally, I strongly believe that taking the decision to have cosmetic surgery reflects a negative development in our communities for the reason that it reveals that plenty of people have mental health issues. For instance, low self-esteem has been increasing among the young population during the last years. Besides that, cosmetic surgery centres the attention on beauty instead of other more important values, such as honesty, creativity and charity. For example, there are fewer Non-Governmental Organizations such as Green Peace at the present moment than in the past.
To conclude, harmful mass media advertising and lower costs of cosmetic surgery translate into a negative development in our communities due to mental health issues and citizens spending money on nonsense. I would strongly recommend that authorities create laws to regulate mass media advertising.",,,,,,7.5,"In recent years, it has become more common for people to undergo cosmetic surgery in order to alter their physical appearance. I believe that the main reasons behind this trend are the increasing influence of social media and advances in medical technology, which have made such procedures safer and more accessible. Social media platforms constantly show celebrities and influencers with what many consider to be perfect bodies and faces, causing ordinary individuals to feel dissatisfied with their natural looks. Furthermore, improvements in surgical methods mean that operations can be completed more quickly and with shorter recovery times, so more people feel comfortable considering this option. In my view, however, this development is mostly negative because it suggests that our society is placing too much importance on physical appearances rather than qualities such as kindness and intelligence. For example, young people might feel pressure to change themselves just to fit in or gain approval from others, which can lead to issues like low self-esteem or even regret after surgery. In conclusion, while cosmetic surgery may help some individuals feel more confident, I think the growing popularity of these procedures signals a worrying shift in our social values and may ultimately lead to more harm than good."

Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"There is currently a contentious argument regarding the purpose of having cosmetic surgery since more and more people prefer to use this method to improve their appearance. Considering the factors that support the decision to choose this improvement method, there are various reasons which I will discuss in this essay. In terms of consequences, I personally believe that there is a positive development.
It is the fact that people have a wide variety of rationales to have cosmetic surgery. An obvious example of this is that people can design their new appearance in the way they wish to be look like. This is because a doctor could perform modern medical techniques such as modifying bone at the patients’ nose to change their real face, which natural face improvement cannot do. Another common reason is the increase in self-confidence. When people have plastic surgery, they tend to believe that their appearance will be more accepted by other people, helping them to feel more confident.
Contemplating the effects of people who have plastic surgery, there are many vital advantages. A common criticism in favour of this is the rise in productivity in workplace. When people feel more confident as a result of having cosmetic surgery, they tend to be more courageous to communicate with people in other departments, leading to the increasing workflow between two teams. Another classic example is building more networking. This is because people who positively improve their appearance tend to attract other people’s attention. As a result, more and more people might want to know them.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that cosmetic surgery could address people’s eagerness to have better appearance and be more confident, which, in my opinion, results in a positive consequence to both society and them. This is because they would have willingness to contact other people and draw other people’s attention to them, which could grow their connections.",,,,,,8.0,"In recent years, the popularity of cosmetic surgery has grown dramatically as more individuals opt to alter their appearance for various reasons. One primary factor driving this trend is the increasing influence of media and social networks, which often set certain beauty standards that many people aspire to achieve. When individuals see celebrities and influencers undergoing successful cosmetic enhancements, they may feel more encouraged to consider similar changes for themselves. Additionally, advancements in medical technology have made procedures safer, less invasive, and more affordable, making cosmetic surgery an accessible solution for a wider range of people. In my view, this development carries both positive and negative consequences. On the one hand, those who undergo cosmetic surgery may experience a boost in self-esteem and satisfaction with their looks, which can translate into improved social and professional interactions. For example, a person who has always felt insecure about a certain feature might feel liberated and more outgoing after surgery. On the other hand, the growing emphasis on physical beauty can contribute to unhealthy societal pressures, leading some individuals to develop body image issues or pursue unnecessary procedures. In conclusion, while cosmetic surgery can empower people to feel better about themselves, it is important to ensure these choices are made based on personal desire rather than external pressure, so that the benefits outweigh the risks."
83,2,Write about the following topic.An increasing number of people are choosing to have cosmetic surgery in order to improve their appearance. Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"People have always desired to improve their external features. However, while the time went by, methods of changing appearance for the better have significantly changed. Today, more and more people decide to improve the way they look via cosmetic surgery. In the following essay I'm going to speculate on the topic and explain some possible reasons of this trend.
Obviously, there are plenty of reasons of this tendancy. To start with, operation is an easy way of improving your appearance. People are attracted by this method because they don't need to go to the gym or control their diet anymore. The only thing they need is to call a special doctor and pay money. In addition, it's obvious that every trend is caused by the changes of standarts in society. Nowadays, the number of people who are sure that unnatural beauty is attractive is growing every day. Affected by the opinion of their friends or family members more and more women decide to use surgery in order to change face or other part of the body.
Personally, I strongly believe that this bandwagon both worsens the way people look harms health as well. I'm convinced that nothing can surpass natural beauty; meanwhile, every medical operation goes against people's organism and spills what was created by the universe. For example, some famous artists who have used cosmetic surgery in order to stay young are now looking like dolls. What's more, sometimes chemicals which are used during such operations can cause awful consequences for not only people's appearance, but for their health as well. I can still remember a story of one boy who wanted to swell his muscles in a shorter way by using some medecine but, as a result, he appeard in a hospital with serious blood illness due to inappropriate choice and careless usage.
Taking everything into account, it's my firm conviction that even though cosmetic surgery seems to be a proper way of improving appearance, it is very overrated. On the contrary, such operations do not only worsen the way people look , but can be extremely dangeraus for their organism as well, while natural beauty is here to stay forever.",,,,,,7.5,"In recent years, cosmetic surgery has become increasingly popular as a method for individuals to transform their appearance. There are several reasons behind this rise. Firstly, society places a huge emphasis on physical attractiveness, often equating it with success and happiness, leading people to feel pressure to look perfect. Secondly, the influence of social media cannot be ignored, as people constantly see images of celebrities and influencers who appear flawless, sometimes openly admitting to having had procedures done. Moreover, technological advances have made cosmetic surgeries safer, more affordable, and more accessible than in the past; therefore, even ordinary people feel encouraged to try them. Despite these reasons, I believe that this trend is largely negative. Changing one's body surgically for aesthetic reasons can be dangerous both physically and psychologically, as repeated procedures may damage self-esteem and health. I know of someone who had surgery to alter her nose and initially felt happier, but soon she started noticing flaws in other parts of her body, leading to a cycle of insecurity. Additionally, society’s obsession with looks often causes people to value appearance above other important traits like kindness or intelligence. In conclusion, while cosmetic surgery offers a quick fix to meet modern beauty standards, I think it leads to more problems than it solves and our focus should shift back to appreciating natural beauty and self-acceptance."

Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"A greater number of individuals opted for plastic surgery to enhance the physical outlook. What could be the reason behind the increasing number of people opting for cosmetic surgery to deter their appearance.
In my opinion the main reason why cosmetic surgery is in demand nowadays is because society has set a certain standard that physical appearance will be the fastest ticket to stand out in the crowd. Second is it boosts confidence to people with low self esteem.
The favorable outcome is not as much the adverse effect to the individuals. Example, the fastest way to reduce wrinkles on the face is to get Botox treatment. It lasts 3-4 months, after that it needs continuous medication to maintain what has been changed. It takes a lot of money to satisfy the demands of the society. On top of that repetition of pain and recovery during and after the surgery.
There are numerous natural ways to enhance beauty and confidence. Contentment, exercise and a healthy lifestyle are effective methods to maintain the genuine beauty of the people. Simple walking in the morning, keeping the distance from negativity and eating vegetables and fruits are the simplest methods that boost the natural glow of the body and prevent us from being sick.
To conclude the essay, I think plastic surgery is not necessary to enhance physical outlook as it uses synthetic components that have harmful effects within the body.",,,,,,7.0,"In recent years, more and more people have decided to undergo cosmetic surgery in an attempt to improve how they look. There are a few reasons why this trend has become so popular. Firstly, social media and celebrities have put a big emphasis on looking perfect, which pressures ordinary people to try and look like the people they see online. As a result, people feel that enhancing their appearance will help them fit in and be more accepted. Additionally, many individuals believe that changing the way they look will make them happier or increase their chances of success in their careers and personal lives. Personally, I see this development as mostly negative. While cosmetic surgery can boost someone’s confidence, it may also lead to physical risks, high costs, and disappointment if results are not as expected. For example, some individuals I know have regretted getting surgery because of side effects or because they felt even more insecure afterwards. Rather than relying on surgery, I think people should be encouraged to accept themselves naturally and focus more on their inner qualities than outward appearance. In conclusion, although the choice for cosmetic surgery is understandable in today’s society, I believe that striving for natural beauty and self-acceptance is healthier and more sustainable in the long run."
87,2,Some people say free time activities for children should be organized by parents. Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Whether parents should fully intervene in their children's organization of their leisure time or let them decide it, remains a big discussion. In this essay I will contrast the two opinions and I will explain why I think a good balance is needed.
One of the reasons supporting the first view is the idea of the undeveloped children's ability to organize. This is because, although some of them might seem very mature for their age, others might struggle understanding the importance of having a routine, besides playing video games. For instance, many parents orientate their children helping them to organize hobbies and teaching a very important skill, time managment.
On the other hand, some people encourage children to decide themselves what to do as this stimulates creativity and personal growth. This view, therefore, opens a new world for the little ones who can decide whatever they like, having multiple options. For example, children in this situation quite often are supported when they want to play sports or participate in a painting class.
In my opinion, parents should not only be envolved as much as they can in all aspects of their children's lives, but also they might encourage the little ones to have personal opinions and decision about their hobbies and leisure actitivities. This may be a good way to build trust and communication between parents and children. Moreover, children learn responsability while being guided by their parents.
In conclusion, some parents help their children more in scheduling their free time, while others intervene less leaving them to create a routine freely. I believe, parents should always be involved in their children's lives and decisions, allowing children participation too, which brings multiple benefits to their relationship.",,,,,,7.0,"The topic of how children should spend their free time causes many different opinions. Some adults believe that parents should carefully plan their children's activities to make sure their time is used for learning and developing useful skills. For example, they might sign their children up for music lessons or swim classes, because they think this will help children become more disciplined and well-rounded. On the other hand, others say that it is important for children to have the freedom to pick what activities interest them most. This can encourage independence and let children discover what makes them happy without too much pressure from adults. They may choose to play imaginative games with friends or simply read a book. Personally, I think both sides have a point, but the best solution is a mix of both approaches. Parents can provide guidance and suggest positive activities, but they should also give children some choice so they feel respected and learn how to make decisions. This way, children can build confidence while still receiving encouragement and support from their family. In summary, while parental involvement is important, giving children some freedom leads to a healthier and more rewarding use of their free time."
89,2,Some people say free time activities for children should be organized by parents. Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"What children like to do in free time ? All children have diffrent ideas and preferences. So that many parenets think what should they provide and organize for their kids or not.
Children have free mind. Sometimes that make out of control their behaviours. In this modern world, we have so manyv tools to connect to out side of their world, for example internet, social network. If parents are not organised to kids's freet time, children have so many chance to take those tools. Not all internet stuffs are bad, but also there are lots of appropriate contents for kids around. Kids should be protected and orverviewed by parents or caregivers whatever they are doing. Moreover, if they are not controlled their free time by parents, kids never have limit of spending time for something they are into it. Time management is important for kids, free time shouldn't be until late night.
On the other hand, what will be happned if parents don't organised their free time.
Kids are using their imagination or ideas in their free time to play. There is no organising stuff from parents, so that they might try to find what they need and want to do. Therefore, they develop their indepndence and social skills.
In my opinion, I think kids should be organised their free time by parents. Compared with both side of effect, I personally choose kids's safety rather than developping independence. Independence and social skills can develop in other situation also. Howevere, kids""s safety cant choose",,,,,,5.0,"Some people believe that free time for children should be structured by parents, while others argue that children should decide for themselves. In favor of parents organizing activities, it is often said that adults know best what is safe and suitable for children. If parents plan their children’s free time, kids are less likely to waste it on screens or get into trouble. Additionally, organized activities like sports, music lessons, or study groups can help children learn discipline and useful skills. However, there is also a strong argument that children need freedom to choose their own activities. When kids play and decide on their own, their creativity and imagination grow. They learn how to be independent and solve problems without adults always telling them what to do. In free play, children can make friends and discover what interests them most. In my own view, I think a balance is best. Parents should guide and suggest safe options, but also let their kids choose some activities for themselves. This way, children can stay safe but also develop independence and confidence."
91,2,Some people say free time activities for children should be organized by parents. Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Apart from education, leisure is an essential part that helps children to discover their interests and develop both physical and mental abilities. While many agree that parents are responsible for managing their children's free time, the others argue that the kids themselves should be entitled to make their own decisions. As a grown up, I personally believe that the kids should be allowed to select activities based on their preferences within the scope provided by the parents, as per the following reasons.
To begin with, no one likes to be forced. After long days of either tiresome work or study, everyone wants to enjoy their time afterwards. This also applies to the students, which in many cultures, are put into after school classes to spend more time tutoring in order to catch up with the academic standards. Although some can endure this intense lifestyle, most of the time, these schedules usually cause the kids to be overworked and stressed. Therefore, it is important to spare some times for the children to manage their own activities. Nevertheless, unlike adults who are financially independent, the kids can be subjected to many limitations.
Despite being able to participate in many activities, the underages must be legally supervised by several reasons, one of them being decision-making abilitiy. Parents can play a very important part in disapproving activities that are inappropriate for the kids. For example, if not accompanied or consulted, children can end up meeting with strangers or playing dangerous extreme sports. Furthermore, most of the time, the underages usually rely on their parents' earnings, which lead back to them approving the recreational budgets.
All in all, it is necessary to allow the kids to have autonomy over their free time as it allows them to develop sense of responsibility along with discovering their interests. However, these decisions must be reviewed and approved by the parents to ensure the budget added and security of the children themselves.",,,,,,7.5,"The question of whether parents should organize their children’s free time or allow them to choose their own activities is a subject of ongoing debate. On one hand, advocates for parental guidance claim that parents have more experience and know which activities are most beneficial for their children’s development. They worry that without supervision, children might spend too much time on unproductive pastimes like playing video games or watching television, missing out on physical activities or creative hobbies. On the other hand, opponents argue that allowing children to choose their own free time activities is essential for building independence and self-confidence. When children have autonomy, they are encouraged to explore their individual interests and discover their unique talents, which leads to greater happiness and a sense of achievement. Personally, I believe that children should have the freedom to select their leisure activities, but within certain boundaries set by parents. By offering gentle guidance and providing a safe environment, parents can help their children make wise choices without imposing too many restrictions. This balance not only promotes healthy development but also ensures that children feel supported while learning how to manage their time and interests responsibly."
93,2,Some people say free time activities for children should be organized by parents. Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"I agree with both: many activities must be organise by parents as kids have not much knowledge about what to do sometimes.
Freedom for childrens is going to the park and play football with other friends, or going to the cinema, but they cannot do everything without parents help.
Cristiano Ronaldo wants to force his kid to be the number one on football, I don't think this is the right way, because he's put so much pressure on him, he should let him choose his life.
Also depends where you live, I think in Australia is easier let your children do some experience by himself, here is a very safety country I don't think parents must be too concerned about their children's also because if you stay too close to them, they will grown spoiled, weak and without self esteem.
Children's should start to make mistake since the beginning and understand what life is...
Parents always protect kids and they don't allow them see bad things but my opinion is: make them ready for the life, even if one thing is uncomfortable or unpleasant let them see, probably the shock will be very high but slowly it will get lighter, strong moments make strong people, weak moments make weak people...
At the end of this topic I can confirm that the best experiences of my life has been made by myself, without parents, without help, just with my friends and my curiosity, parents must follow us until the end of our childhood but after that, we have to start work with our feet.",,,,,,5.0,"There are lots of reasons why some parents think it is better to organize free time for their children, because they believe they know what is best for them. When kids are young, they often don’t have a clear idea what activities are good or safe, so it can actually help if parents decide things like piano lessons or swimming classes. But on the other side, if parents are always deciding, the children miss chances to figure out what really makes them happy and maybe never learn how to make choices. Sometimes, kids just want simple things like meeting friends, riding a bike or drawing for fun and this is also important, because real happiness comes from doing things they love, not just what parents schedule. My own feeling is that a good parent finds balance. They can suggest activities and sometimes organize, but they should also listen and give their children space to choose. That way, kids start to feel more responsible, and even if they make mistakes, it helps them grow stronger and more confident in the future."
95,2,In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .,"Young people in some countries are encouraged to take one gap year to work or travel abroad between their high school and university studies. This essay will discuss both of the benefits and drawbacks of the experiences of one year adventure in foreign countries for young people.
To start with, there are several advantages to this adventure abroad. Firstly, young people can meet people from different cultures, beliefs, and ages, and broaden their thoughts and experiences of the world. For instance, they may have cultural shock and reflect their own views and values about life and the world. In this way, they may become more open-minded and tolerant of different people and cultures. Secondly, they can make friends with people in other countries and broaden their social networks. This can become long-term friendships and they can gain a global perspective of the world. This is not only beneficial for themselves, but it can also benefit their societies and countries in long run as well.
However, there are also potential drawbacks to this journey. First and foremost, they can encounter some dangerous situations, such as being scammed, robbed, and even physically harmed. Numerous reports in the media about unfortunate cases that young people in foreign countries being kidnapped, forced to consume or sell drugs, and even being killed. It could be dangerous for them if they meet local gangster bands and have no one to rescue them. Therefore, it is essential that young people take precautions to keep their safety while abroad.
To sum up, although there are potential risks in the one-year journey, the advantages of broadening their horizons of thoughts, becoming open-minded, and experiences of forming new friendships with people in other countries could outweigh the disadvantages if the young people take measures for their safety while abroad.",,,,,,7.5,"After graduating from high school, many young people in certain countries are encouraged to spend a year working or traveling before entering university. There are several advantages to this practice. To begin with, taking a gap year allows students to gain valuable life experiences that can help them mature and better understand themselves. For example, by working, they can earn money and develop skills such as time management and communication, which are essential for adulthood. In addition, those who choose to travel get the chance to learn about different cultures and ways of life, which may help them become more independent and adaptable in new environments. However, there are some disadvantages as well. One major concern is that young people may lose academic motivation or find it hard to get back into the habits of studying after a year away from the classroom. Furthermore, travel and work experiences can be expensive, and not all students can afford them, which might create inequality. Some might also encounter dangerous or uncomfortable situations while far from home. In conclusion, although taking a break between high school and university offers many benefits like personal growth and broader worldviews, it also comes with risks and challenges, so young people should consider their choices carefully."
97,2,In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .,"In other nations, after graduation in high school, youth are encouraged to go overseas for travel or to find a job for a period of one year prior to enrollment in universities for continuing studies. Some people believed that these have an effect on young people. The advantages on young people when working or traveling before entering college are saving money and making funds which can be used for matriculation, and they can have enough time for mental break which foster mental health that will help them more prepared individual as student. While the disadvantages are waste of money when traveling and delayed finishing studies when working.
Moreover, when deciding to take an educational break for travel or work between finishing high school and entering in college has advantages. First would be making funds for enrollment fees and saving money for allowance. Young people can have the opportunity to support themselves in their studies instead of asking financial support from parents. By this way, they become more independent because they can provide their daily necessities. Second would be achieving healthy mental health through traveling abroad. For some students, high school is stressful just like college especially when they are too serious in studying. Going abroad for a vacation might help to destress the students at the same time giving self a time for relaxation which is essential to the mind and body.
However, this decision also brings disadvantages to young people like wasting of money or savings from parents when traveling abroad. Instead of saving this money for college, it is used for booking a trip, hotel accommodation, and other recreational activities. Another would be waste of time, because instead of finishing studies on time in a university, students might be delayed in their graduation because of a year spent in vacation. As a consequence, timeline in studying and getting a degree is longer than usual.",,,,,,5.5,"In certain countries, it is common for young people to take a gap year between finishing high school and beginning university by either working or traveling. There are several benefits for students who choose this path. Firstly, working allows young people to develop important life skills such as responsibility, time management, and teamwork, in addition to earning money that can be used to help pay for university expenses. Traveling can also teach young adults about different cultures, broaden their outlook, and give them a greater sense of independence. On the other hand, there are disadvantages as well. One main drawback is that students may lose motivation to return to academic life or find it difficult to adapt to the routine and discipline of university after a year away from formal studies. Also, spending a year traveling may lead to financial strain, especially if the individual does not manage their funds wisely. Furthermore, taking a break can result in graduating later than peers, which might affect career progression.

It is widely accepted that young people should travel or work for a year between completing high school and beginning university studies. From a personal perspective, the benefits are more significant than the drawbacks for young people who decide to have a gap year.
On the one hand, most students who just completed high school education have stressful periods and lots of plans that want to do. Young people could feel disoriented which means they need time for finding what they want. There are a lot of youths who put themselves under pressure thus, they get more and more stress in their study and work and can get some mental illness. In order to have a gap year, they will have enough time to relax and establish a plan for their future. Nowadays, more and more students decide to choose a year to do anything that they hope to perform. Besides, their decision will help them understand themselves, and have opportunities to experience jobs that have not been done before such as volunteer work and long-day traveling.
On the second hand, there are some negative points of a gap year for the youths. The young people who decide to have a free year will face late completing university studies which may lead to having fewer opportunities than their peers deciding to start university immediately. On some occasions, it is difficult for young people who do not have any experience to find internship jobs. Thus, they may waste lots of time without any achievement.
To sum up, the gap year will bring more experiences for young people. It is my belief that the advantages outweigh the others.",,,,,,6.5,"In recent years, the idea of taking a gap year after high school before starting university has become more popular in many countries. Young people are often encouraged to spend this year either working or traveling, and there are both positive and negative aspects to this choice. On the one hand, a gap year can be very helpful for young people who need a break after the stress of school. It gives them a chance to learn new skills, experience different cultures, and become more independent. For instance, by working or traveling, they can improve their communication abilities and learn how to manage money, which are important for adult life. A gap year can also give students extra time to think about their future and make better decisions regarding what they want to study at university. On the other hand, there are also disadvantages to consider. Some students may struggle to get back into the habit of studying after a year away from school, and they may forget some of what they learned in high school. Additionally, delaying university might mean they graduate later than their friends, which can feel discouraging. Not every young person can afford to travel or find a rewarding job, so their gap year experience might not be as useful as hoped. In conclusion, while taking a gap year is not suitable for everyone, it can provide valuable life lessons and help young people prepare for university and adult life, as long as they make the most of the opportunities available to them."
101,2,In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .,"Over decades, there has been a belief that adults should support adolescents to work in a company or travel to another country at least one year before going to university. Despite the fact that there are many positive aspects of having experiences in terms of working and travelling before studying at university, with a careful consideration, there are also negative points of this.
It is true that working or travelling before starting a university program positively affects juveniles’ development. A classic example of this is an effective way to truly understand their academic preferences. When juveniles have work experiences, such as having a one-year internship in a company, they tend to learn a wide variety of work functions, helping them know the academic discipline they want to learn at university. Another benefit from taking a long journey to another place before studying at university is the opportunity to get exposed to new culture. This is because while adolescents are on an epic expedition to other parts of the world, they tend to meet new people with different nationality and belief, leading to valuable life experiences that they cannot receive from a professor at university.
In spite of the aforementioned advantages of working or travelling before starting university courses, there are also drawbacks. A common example of this is graduating from a college late, compared to juveniles who immediately start a university program after they finish high school. This is exemplified by Thai culture which believes that young people who graduate from university later than their peer would not have a successful career path. In addition, opponents of this notion might argue that working before finishing university is not well worth doing. Since most works require a strong academic foundation in order for juveniles to deliver results with fewer mistakes, the juveniles should study at university instead.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that having work experiences or taking a journey before starting a university life has many benefits for young people with respect to knowing the academic fields they want to study and learning new cultures outside a classroom. Nevertheless, doing this could also have drawbacks in terms of the delay in university graduation and an ineffective performance in working.",,,,,,7.5,"In recent years, it has become common practice in several nations for young adults to take a gap year after completing high school but before enrolling in university. There are distinct advantages and disadvantages to this approach. On the positive side, a gap year offers young people the luxury of time to explore different career paths, either through employment or travel, which can help them discover their passions and make wiser decisions regarding future studies. By entering the workforce, they may develop practical skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, all of which are valued in both academic and professional settings. Similarly, traveling exposes them to diverse cultures and ways of thinking, broadening their horizons and building independence. However, these benefits are counterbalanced by certain disadvantages. For instance, taking a year off can disrupt academic momentum, making it difficult for some students to readjust to the rigors of university studies. Furthermore, a delayed start to university may mean entering the job market later than their peers, potentially increasing pressure to catch up in both studies and career progression. There is also the risk that some young people may not use the year productively, leading to wasted time and potential regret. In summary, while taking a year to work or travel before university can offer personal growth and valuable experiences, it may also lead to challenges such as loss of motivation and delayed career advancement."
103,2,The advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is currently a contentious argument that using English as an international language will always have more benefits than drawbacks. Despite the use of English, which has been spreading globally, has positive effects on communication in various aspects, I personally believe that the disadvantages of the spread of English will eventually be more significant.
It is true that when more and more countries use English as a common language, the advantages of this implementation will outweigh its negative consequences. A classic example of this is that people from any country could communicate to each other in the easier way. This is because there will be no language barrier, preventing people to deliver their messages to others. Furthermore, using English globally tend to have less misunderstanding when communicating. This is exemplified by natives who live in the same country and speak the same language. These people can understand what each other say completely. Therefore, in terms of global perspective, if everyone has conversations in English, misleading communication tend to be less occurred.
In spite of the aforementioned positive consequences of the growing use of English, there are also potential drawbacks. A common example of this is the missing of some languages. Languages which are only used by small groups of people tend to fade away due to the fact that the majority of people would pay more attention to English without conserving these languages. In addition, nations that do not apply English as an international language tend to have small global economic growth. This is because most countries in international markets can understand English. Hence, countries whose people are unable to apply English could inevitably have less opportunities to make commercial deals with other countries, having the ability to speak English.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that the spread of English positively affects the way people from different countries communicate to each other and significantly decreases inaccurate information in conversations. Nevertheless, as this development can lead to the lost in other languages and the declining economy of some countries, I totally disagree with the notion that the advantages of the increasing popularity of English will continue to outweigh the disadvantages. This is because I personally think that the aforementioned negative impacts are the two most crucial aspects when using English.",,,,,,8.5,"It is often argued that the escalating use of English worldwide brings more advantages than disadvantages, and that this trend will persist into the future. While it is clear that the global spread of English helps people from various countries to interact more efficiently, I am convinced that the disadvantages will ultimately be more significant. Firstly, English serves as a common tool for communication, enabling students, tourists, and businesses to exchange ideas with far less confusion. As an illustration, international conferences and scientific research use English to ensure experts can share their knowledge regardless of their origin. On the other hand, the dominance of English may endanger local languages and cultures. Many minor languages are disappearing because young people prefer to learn English for better opportunities, leading to cultural loss. In addition, relying on English can disadvantage those who lack access to adequate education or resources to acquire it, making it harder for them to participate in the global economy. In summary, although the widespread use of English improves international dialogue and cooperation, I disagree that its benefits will always be greater than the drawbacks, as language loss and increased inequality are serious consequences that cannot be overlooked."

Human with their awareness, cognition reveal that the advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. I agree with this statement. Firstly, English as a primary invention for interactions and social communicating have been playing an important role for the innovative development of the society, to identify, some countries in the world are colonized by the United Kingdom became more revolutional and now developed, as a consequence, the culture of learning the international language which is English is spreaded through nations and generations of migrating from countries to countries, this create a better understanding and initialize investments between the developed and the undeveloped ones through an international language. Moreover, English is a both logical and basic international language, throughout years of developing, English with its' improvements in meanings and pronunciations, is recognized as a familiarity to everyone, it is gradually becoming easier and not too complicated for people to learn, as a result, English can expedite the problem of language barrier and easily becomes a global language. Furthermore, English as an international language with its' ease and uncomplicated structures can get people the opportunity to get themselves their employment, since English is already known as a popularity in ways of interacting with languages, verbal communication, if English can be spreaded, it can cure the problems of unemployment and a lack of work force.

Firstly, English allows individuals from varied countries to cooperate in important areas like technology, medicine, and business, resulting in more possibilities for both trade and cultural exchange. Additionally, learning English as a global language helps job seekers increase their career options, since numerous multinational companies require employees to communicate efficiently in English. While it is true that the dominance of English may threaten minority languages and risk the loss of cultural uniqueness, it also provides a common ground for education and information sharing, which helps impoverished regions to access opportunities for growth. Furthermore, English often serves as a neutral means of communication in international politics, reducing misunderstandings that could lead to problems. In conclusion, even though some negative aspects are present, English as a global language brings more benefits to society, making it a valuable tool for progress across the world."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is no doubt that these days more people is learning and talking by English language. The question is, is this viral of English has a negative view or not? In this essay I will discuss and draw my personal conclusion.
In terms of advantages there is many. Firstly, this spread of English language wil make the communication easier more than before . In other words, travelling to a new country that you are not speak there language is not a big problem these days because most of people are speaking English or at least know the main essential questions and there answers .To illustrate, If you are travelling to Italy you don't have to learn Italian language your English will be enough. Secondly, some languages are hard to learn like Chinese and Turkish, so using the English as a united language is much easier than using other language.
Moreover the massive spread to English may had some disadvantages the main given reason I support this claim is that the consist of using English language in countries will make some other languages disappear. To illustrate, some countries now are choosing not to speak with their naive language and replace it with English in work and school and all daily conversations. On other hand, some countries like Turkey most of their citizens will ignore you when you don't ask them with Turkish.
In conclusion, although this spread of English may diminish other languages, but still having English language is important. That's why I believe that using English is essential especially if you are working with international companies and collegues.",,,,,,6.0,"In today’s world, it is common to see people in many countries using English to communicate. Some people argue that the dominance of English can have a bad impact on local languages and cultures, while others believe the benefits from this global language are much stronger. In my opinion, I agree that the advantages of English spreading around the world are more important. Firstly, English makes it easier for people from different countries to communicate with each other when traveling or doing business. For example, students from different nations can study together in universities with English as the medium, and companies can work with partners from everywhere without confusion. Also, English is the main language for science, technology, and the internet, so knowing it unlocks many sources of information and more job opportunities. On the other hand, it is true that local languages and traditions might become weaker if everyone uses English all the time, and some people may forget their native tongue. However, I think governments can encourage their citizens to protect their culture and still learn English for practical reasons. In conclusion, I believe the positive effects of English becoming a global language are greater than its drawbacks, because it helps people understand each other and creates more chances for education and work."
109,2,The advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In today's life, English is one of the biggest common language in the world. It is often argued that the benefits of learning English as a global language will superior to its drawbacks continueously. I completely agree with this idea due to the fact that English is one of the easiest language to learn and most education system in the world involve English as one of the courses.
English should be continue to use as a global langauge because it is easy to learn. Each language in the world involves different movings of the tongue in the mouth, but some of the languages have similar tongue positions with English, such as Italian, Spanish and French. It will be difficult for people in the world to start adapting a new language and using completely different tongue positions. For example, chinese, one of the most challengeable langauge in the world, it mostly does not need the support of the tongue to touch the teeth or anything else. It is hard for people with other mother language to adapt the pronounciation. Therefore, one of the biggest advantages of English as a common language is the easyness of it.
In addition to the easyness of English, numorous education systems in the world include English as one of the important subjects to learn support the benefits of English that will continue to overseed its disadvantages. Since English as one of the spreading languages in the world lasts for many years. A lots of generations learn English since their childhood and English already take a huge part of their educational studies. It is hard for people to abandon this language and step out of their comfort zone. For instance, one of my best chilldhood friend learn English for almost 6 years, but since she went to Spain for two years as exchange students, she get used to the way of learn English, instead of Spanish, so she fell her grade there. It is clear that English as one of the essential courses in world, it has an important connection with the education system globally and it has a huge influence in our studies.
In conclusion, the easyness of learning English and the crucial role of it in the educations system support my opinion that I completely believe that the advantages of spreading English as an important language in the world will keep outweigh its flaws.",,,,,,6.5,"There is no doubt that English has gained the status of a global language in today’s society. Some people think that spreading English everywhere brings more positive effects than negative ones. I mostly agree with this viewpoint, because the use of English makes international communication easier and helps people to find better job opportunities in different countries. First, English helps people from different backgrounds talk to each other more easily. With English, tourists, students, and businesspeople can express themselves clearly in almost any country. For instance, a person from Japan can visit France and still get directions or order food in English, which is practical and helpful. Also, English as a common language can reduce misunderstandings between nations and even help solve problems faster, such as during global emergencies. Second, knowing English gives people an advantage in their careers. Many companies expect workers to speak English, especially big companies that have customers and offices worldwide. People who can speak English can apply for jobs in many places, travel for work, or work with people from other countries. Although some might say that using only English could harm other local languages and cultures, I believe the advantages of easy communication and better chances for jobs are more important.

There is a variety of advantages because the number of English speakers, including non-native speakers has been increasing across the globe. I strongly agree with this phenomenon.
To go into detail, European countries, such as Switzerland, and Belgium are configured with some languages in one country, such as German, French, and Italian. Therefore, English is categorized as a common language in these countries. In addition, the US and European countries have been leading in a variety of fields, such as science, technology, and academic topics. Therefore, some countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and north European countries followed learning English to keep up with technology. Therefore, the number of non-native speakers has widely and drastically increased in Europe to communicate smoothly. As a result, since internet technology has widely spread around the world, Japanese people can search for any kind of information in English more than five times higher than searching for the same information in Japanese. Therefore, learning English is inevitable for Japanese people, as well as other Asian countries or developing countries.

115,2,"Write about the following topic.To meet the growing need for food to support an increasing population, a country should make use of edible insects as a food source. However, some people believe that insects are not only unhealthy but harvesting them will also negatively affect nature. What are the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Some countries and culture already utilize insects as part of food source. As such, it can be relatively inexpensive to consume insects - which are often freely found in certain environments and do not take much skill to be collected, killed and consumed - as compared to the cost and manual labor involved in raising animal livestock, butchering, as well as preparing the meat for consumption. Similarly agriculture also involves consistent manual labor, and has costs associated with it, including for machinery and materials needed. However, people may be against the idea of consuming insects due to the novelty of it, and they may also feel disgust around it. As the prompt states, some may find it unhealthy. Harvesting insects on purpose will also require some physical and psychological work - but the benefit here is that it may be easier than harvesting large animals or cultivating crops.
I have never consumed an insect product - and my father has mentioned to me that had lived in such-and-such country, I would not be so scared of cockroaches - viewing them as a food source. He intended this to be an ironic comment, meant to comfor me somewhat due to my strong aversion to cockroaches. However, he may be correct! For individuals socialized in such a society, their aversion to roaches may be lower than mine. Hence, part of the issue here is socialization and accepting this new food norm, should it be novel to the individual and/or the country.
I have tried an octopus for the first time when I was around 20 years old - as I was curious about this dish called Takoyaki, and had heard good reviews of it. It was not unpleasant to eat the ocotpus, per se, but I likely will not go back to it. All in all, new experiences, including consumption of new types of food, may create strong aversion at first, but once dip your toes into it, so to speak, it may be tamer than the experience you were expecting - even if you never go back to eating it again.",,,,,,6.0,"Using edible insects as a food source is a topic that comes with both advantages and disadvantages, particularly in the face of an expanding global population that requires more food. On one hand, insects are highly efficient in converting feed into protein, requiring much less water and land compared to traditional livestock like cows or pigs. Additionally, raising insects tends to produce fewer greenhouse gases, making them a more environmentally friendly option. For example, crickets and mealworms can be farmed with very limited resources and are already staple foods in many countries in Asia, showing that edible insects are not just a theoretical solution but a practical one in some regions. On the other hand, there are concerns about health and environmental impacts. Some argue that insects may carry pathogens or toxins if not properly farmed, and large-scale harvesting of wild insects could upset local ecosystems by disrupting food chains and pollination. Personally, I have never eaten insects, but I know someone who tried chocolate-covered ants while traveling in Thailand and described it as both a cultural adventure and a surprisingly tasty snack. Despite their positive experience, I can understand how many people—including myself—might feel hesitant because eating insects seems unfamiliar or unappealing due to societal norms. Ultimately, while edible insects offer a promising way to meet food demands sustainably, careful consideration of health standards and environmental protection is necessary to make them a part of the mainstream diet."

In some Southeast Asia countries such as Thailand and Columbia, bugs like spiders and grasshoppers are common protein sources for the general public. To solve the food shortage in the growing population around the world, there is a voice to consume insect-based products instead of traditional meats. Meat industries have a negative reputation for being eco-unfriendly. Also, not all the family can afford to have meat. So is insect-based food a solution to the population booming era?
First of all, let us look into what insects take part in the ecosystem, Insects are at the bottom of the food chain. It means that many animals consume bugs as their main diet. One of the concerns of humans eating insects for food is whether the collection of insects will affect the environment. Over-collecting insects may endanger some species which rely on insects to survive. Farming insects may be an idea to grow insects for food but the impact on the farming environment is still under observation.
Food safety is another concern of eating insects. There are a few thousand kinds of insects, some of which are known as poison. Although most of the edible insects do not contain poison, identifying which kinds of insects are safe to eat will be an issue.
Nevertheless, eating insects can be an option. There are some countries that are mature in having insects. Whichever sources of the insects are safe and eco-friendly, insects can be a subsidy of proteins when lacking meat sources. However, there is still a long road for insects to become the main source of food in this state.",,,,,,9.0,"Including edible insects in our diets could help address the rising demand for food in countries with growing populations, but there are both advantages and disadvantages to this approach. One key benefit is that insects are a rich source of protein and essential nutrients, and they are generally more environmentally friendly to farm than livestock, requiring less land, water, and feed. For example, crickets use much less water to produce the same amount of protein as beef. As a result, incorporating insects into our diets could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve precious resources. On the other hand, there are challenges to widespread insect consumption. Many people have cultural or psychological barriers to eating insects, finding the idea unpleasant or unfamiliar. In addition, improper harvesting of wild insects could disrupt local ecosystems, as insects play crucial roles like pollination and breaking down organic material. Health concerns also arise, since not all insects are safe to eat, and some may cause allergic reactions or carry harmful pathogens if not prepared correctly. In conclusion, while eating insects presents promising solutions to food security and environmental sustainability, it is important to address potential health risks and environmental impacts, and to ensure that people are willing to accept insects as a regular part of their diet."

One of the solution being brought into spotlight is consuming insects. While some people believe that this can be a proper path to end the world's hunger, others argue that it will further lead new problems.
To begin with, there are various aspects of advantages in using bugs as protein substitutes. Bugs are not only available in all continents but the majority of them have short life cycles. If farms shift to grow insects rather than the currently available lifestock, less costs and investments will be needed as they only need weeks to mature while other lifestocks require months or even years. Then, what prevent the humanity to covert to insectivore?
As well as tremendous benefits, the idea of consuming athropods can raise numbers of concerns. Introduction of new insect species and increase of their populations can extremely affect native ecosystem. To elaborate this, alien species introduced from one area to another can be dangerously invasive and can ultimately result in extinction of native species. One example is gold fish which were released into lakes can multiply their populations in short period and over the years, they doubled in size and eradicated their counterparts in original food chain. Therefore, arthropods which are much smaller and aglier can effortlessly escape farms and survive in extreme environment will cause disasters to the nature and crops in the farming areas.

As the world population continues to grow rapidly, members of society have expressed concerns over food supplies and demand. A huge percentage of the world population are experiencing starvation and nutrients deficiency. In order to solve world hunger issues, providing edible insects as an option for food could be a feasible solution.
Chicken, beef, fishes, are some of the most common food products in the current days. There are thorough and informative research on them to ensure people are consuming them consciously. On the other hand, the same couldn't be said about insects. A large group of people seem to believe that they are an unhealthy food option. This could be due to the the insect habitats, which may seem unsanitary compared to other sources of protein. Furthermore, harvesting insects may negatively affect nature.

Eating insects can provide important benefits, such as being a rich source of protein and requiring fewer resources like water and land compared to traditional livestock. For example, crickets and mealworms are high in nutrients and easier to farm, making them an environmentally friendly choice. On the other hand, some people argue that insects might not be healthy to eat, as insects can carry diseases or be contaminated with pesticides if not prepared properly. There are also concerns about the impact of insect harvesting on the environment, since removing large numbers of insects could disrupt local ecosystems and harm plants and animals that depend on them. While some cultures have eaten insects for generations without any problems, others are still hesitant because of health worries and cultural attitudes. Overall, while edible insects could help meet the demand for food in the future, it is important to consider both their advantages and the possible risks to health and nature before making them a common part of the diet."

There are more and more elderly men and women in the world .In my home country ,there are 40% elderly people.The elderly people society will bring a lot of questions to us,but we must face with thes questions.
All of us konw that the elderly people can not work,and they must be looked after,but we love them,because they are our fathers and mothers ,they are working many many years,and some day we will become old people ,then we need to look after by new younger men .
We need many youngers that can join us.The elderly people can not do much things,for example take a bus,go to hosiptal and even walk.Maybe they need someone next to themselves all of the time.
I think that the elderly people do not need to be managed,they need to be loved,because they are the people,they are not the anomals or some things.people need love,not manage.The looking after is not managing.
Althought the elderly people do not need to be managed ,we need the some new tech-ways to look after them,for examples wo can use the computers, cell phones and other tools to help the elderly people.
Everyone must feel that society will be able to cope with the increase in numbers of elderly people today,we must be brave.We must work hard and hard .
We are ready for the elderly people society,and I hope that all of the elderly people are happiness.Elderly is not the end,it is a begining.",,,,,,4.5,"Nowadays, as health care keeps improving, there are more and more elderly people living longer in every country, and this is a big challenge for society. For example, in my city, I can see that many families have grandparents at home, and some of them need a lot of help because they cannot walk very well or they get sick easily. I think society can cope with the growing number of elderly people, but it will not be simple. First, families of these old people should try their best to help, because family love is very important when people are older. Second, the government should build more special hospitals and community centers for old people, so they can have a place to get medicine or do activities together. In addition, we should use new technology, like wheelchairs, alarms, or phones, to let the elderly get help quickly when they need it. In my school, we sometimes visit a home for old people, and I see that they are happy when young people talk to them. So, I believe it is important to care for old people with our hearts, not just with management. If all young people and the government work together, and if society tries to give respect to the elderly, then I believe we can manage the problem and help old people enjoy their lives."

However, I am inclined to believe that the increase of elderly people will be under control. While many challenges are likely to taken place, there will be effective ways to manage this civil segment with the cooperation of both government and private sectors.
As the elderly population is expanding, the demand for nursing homes or elders’ clubs are on the increase. To meet this demand, private sectors are investing on this type of institutions and services as they foresee the lucrative profit these businesses can probably generate in the near future. Apparently, young people are occupied with their daily job which makes it impossible to take care of their parents or grandparents. Therefore, sending the elderly to nursing homes or hiring personal care service are reasonable options to be consider.
Another reason to validate my opinion is the balance in labor force. While some developed countries are experiencing aging population, the scenario is opposite in developing countries whose birth rate is considerably high. As a result, many developed countries such as Germany have encouraged a welcoming entry of those young laborers into its nursing industry. One of my friend has been settling in Germany following her moving to the country 5 years ago to become a nursing staff in privately-owned elderly clubs.
Last but not least, government interference in elderly care is highly recommended. It is suggested that the government allocate more budget to establish publicly-owned elderly homes to mitigate the financial burden to acquire this service. Moreover, regulations on pension plan should be properly adjusted and taken more seriously by employers so that people are assured financially when they are retire.
In conclusion, I believe the elderly problem is likely to be handled well if there are joint effort of both private and public sectors in creating healthcare system and human resource management.",,,,,,6.5,"With the advancement of healthcare and medical technology, people are living longer than ever, which means societies everywhere are facing the challenge of caring for a growing elderly population. I think that, although the increase in elderly people may seem overwhelming, society will eventually be able to handle this issue if we take coordinated action across different levels. One way to address the problem is through collaboration between the government and private organizations to provide a variety of support options, such as subsidized nursing homes, at-home care services, and community centers for seniors. In my city, for instance, there has been a recent expansion of public health centers that offer physical therapy and social activities, which helps keep elderly people healthy both physically and mentally. Additionally, as some countries experience a shortage of local caregivers, they have started to employ workers from abroad, which helps balance out the workforce and ensures that enough staff are available. Lastly, it is crucial for governments to invest more in pensions and health insurance, so that elderly individuals can live with financial security and dignity. In summary, while there are certainly problems to overcome, I believe society can cope with the rise in elderly citizens if we are proactive, invest wisely, and encourage participation from all sectors."

This as good as it is, aslo raised the cncern of tkaing care of elderly people. In my opinion, I believe that the ability to deal with this concern depends on two main factors, which are the degree of country developement as well as the society characteristics.
First of all, to be able to take care of elderly people, the relevant orginizations and innstitutions should be in place. However, this condition most of the time cannot be found in under-developed countires. That is because of the lack of funding resources. On the other hand, more developed countries, such as The Netherlands, Norway, and other european countires, are more capable of taking care of elderly. That is because they have the enough resources to fund such non-profitable orginizations.
Nevertheless, other factor that must be taken into account, is the society characteristcs. Here we mean, wheather the society is considered individualist or socialist. In social societies, countries do not need to allocate a lot of resources on elderly care, because this role is already taken by families. Where in individualist societies, most of the times elder people will be living alone. Therefore, when they reach the point where they cannot take care of themselves, they will go to elderly care houses.
To summarize, the ability to taking care of elderly people depends on two main factors, the country developement and the society type. If the country is developed or the society is considered social, taking care of the mental and physical health of elderly people will be eaiser. In contrast, if the country institutions are under-developed or the society is considered individualist, taking care of eldery people will be much harder.",,,,,,6.0,"With the constant advancements in health care, people now are able to live much longer than before, which means that societies everywhere are facing the challenge of a growing elderly population. I believe whether or not society can cope with this issue depends a great deal on government planning and the involvement of communities. In wealthier countries, such as Japan and Germany, there are already a number of government programs designed to provide both medical and social care for elderly citizens, and these programs may serve as good models for other nations. In contrast, in less developed countries, sometimes family members are expected to take care of their older relatives, which can put a heavy burden on families, especially when both parents have to work. To manage the situation better, I think society should both increase funding for elderly care facilities and also encourage intergenerational interaction, like having young people volunteer in nursing homes or creating shared activities. From my own experience, I have observed that my grandparents were happier and healthier when family visited them regularly, but they also benefited a lot from professional health care services. Overall, with proper planning, cooperation, and respect for the elderly, society can successfully respond to the challenges of an aging population."

For one thing, advancements in technology, such as telemedicine and artificial intelligence, are already making it easier for older adults to access medical care without having to leave their homes. Also, many communities are creating support services, like day centers and home-care assistance, which help elderly people live independently for as long as possible. From a financial perspective, governments need to adjust pensions and healthcare funding to support longer lives, perhaps encouraging people to work longer or save more for retirement. I have seen in my local area how public transportation and buildings are being made more accessible, and how volunteer organizations are providing companionship and assistance to older adults.

Another way to help is by investing in community services, like adult day centers and home care support, so that elderly people can remain active and healthy. In some countries, for instance, families get government assistance to care for their aging relatives, which makes it easier for everyone. Furthermore, since medical technology lets people live with illness for longer, there should be more training for caregivers and more opportunities for elderly people to stay involved in communities.

Firstly,homework could examine student's learning results.After teaching the basic content,giving some homework is important to consolidate the knowledge.As an old saying goes,practice makes things perfect.Only doing many practices,can we master the knowledge proficiently.There is an example.In my teaching experiences,I found the students finishing their homework better would achieve higher scores in final examination,while those who couldn't finish their ordinary homework would gain lower grades in any examination.And my translation skills were also improved by practicing the homework from my guiders who gave the targeted examination to me.
Secondly,too much homework will cause so many negative effects,such as making students tired very much,causing their depressed mood and their bored emotion.For example,my brother's daughter always suffered from the huge homework which was assigned by his Chinese teacher.She once complained with me that everyday she felt tired and bored after finishing Chinese teacher's assignments.So appropriate homework is reasonable for most students and those ideas that the more homework,the better students' scores ,are wrong to certain extent.Sometimes huge homework is the reason that why some students'scores are reduced.
In sum,removing homework is not an ideal option for student's improvement in learning,and reasonable homework provides us a better way to deal with the problem.That is to say,we should strike a balance between assigning homework and removing homework.",,,,,,6.0,"The debate about whether schoolchildren should be given homework has divided opinions for years. Some people think homework is unnecessary, arguing that it simply adds extra stress to students’ lives without bringing real educational benefits. They point out that children already spend many hours in class and need their free time for relaxation, hobbies, and developing social skills. On the other hand, others believe homework is a crucial part of the learning process because it helps students review what they have learned, develop independent study habits, and take responsibility for their own education. For example, in my experience, doing math problems at home after school helped me remember important concepts and prepared me for future lessons. However, I have also seen classmates who are overwhelmed by too much homework and lose interest in learning altogether. In my opinion, teachers should assign a reasonable amount of meaningful homework rather than none at all or excessive amounts. This way, students can benefit from extra practice without feeling burdened, leading to a more balanced and effective education."

I completely agree that assigned homework can put unhealthy stress on children. However, there is one significant benefit of giving young school children homework in moderation, provided that they are not assessed traditionally as they are today.
In regards to giving children a redundant amount of homework, there are some drawbacks to consider. Many people, especially parents, are worried for their childrens quality of life when they are expected to perform outside of school classes. This can be because some children show a range of symptoms connected to performance anxiety, which might be caused by their own expectations of achieving certain grades. Since they are taught on an everyday basis that they have to perform on a high level at school, in order to satisfy the teacher, they are at risk of not experiencing the positive aspects of being a child.
By contrast, many other adults argue that home assignments plays a vital role in childrens´ life, so they are adequately educated from an early stage. The significant advantage of implementing homework in elementary school is that pupils will learn study strategies and be able to familiarise themselves with the concept, before the homework becomes more difficult as they get older. If they would not be handed out homework tasks at all, they may find themselves in a situation where they are not able to keep up the pace.
In conclusion, while I strongly agree that putting a immense amount of pressure on young school children by grading their works is contraproductive, I think home assignments are necessary to give children an opportunity to adjust to how school works in real life. In other words, teachers should not grade childrens homework to release some of their pressure, instead they should assess tasks by speaking about their weaknesses only.",,,,,,7.0,"Some people are of the opinion that teachers should not assign homework to children, arguing that young students deserve free time after school for rest and play. These individuals point out that assigning too much homework can lead to unnecessary stress, reducing the time children have to relax with their families or take part in activities that are important for their personal development. Furthermore, it can cause some students to develop a negative attitude towards learning, due to being overwhelmed or frustrated. On the other hand, supporters of homework claim it is vital for reinforcing what students have learned in class. They believe that without homework, students may forget key concepts and fall behind their peers. In addition, homework can teach valuable life skills such as responsibility and time management, which will benefit children in future academic and professional pursuits. In my view, a balanced approach is best, where homework is given in reasonable amounts and designed to support classroom learning rather than simply occupying the child’s free time. For example, when I was a student, small, meaningful assignments helped me remember important facts, but excessive homework only made me feel anxious. Therefore, it is important for teachers to be thoughtful about the type and amount of homework they assign, ensuring it serves a clear educational purpose while allowing children enough time to enjoy other aspects of their lives."

Some people,however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","My custom topic: It is important for people to take risks, in both their professional lives and personal lives.
Do the advantages of taking these risks outweigh the disadvantages?
I personally think that taking risks is inevitable in this day and age. There may be some drawbacks, but there it cannot be denied that there are certainly benefits.
Firstly, risks are necessary for us to move forward. Without risks, there would be no innovation, and without innovation, there will be no progress for humankind. Humankind is built on the foundation of risk-takers who not only achieved their goals of making the world a better place but also learnt to ability to get back up after their countless failures.
Secondly, by not taking the chance provided and taking a risk, they are missing out on amazing opportunities that could never be achieved unless you have the confidence, determination and conviction to follow the unknown path ahead. These opportunities could easily get them ahead in life, and they would never come true unless they stroll out of their conform zone.
Althought that is the case, it is undeniable that the amount of risk for professional and personal lives is vastly different. If they fail in their personal life, this could hurt in the short term, for example, you could need financial support if you had a family feud. This short-term loss could be a disadvantage in life, but it may not be as crucial as its effect on professional lives, for example, a career change could involve a big pay cut, which could be quite influential on professional lives.
Overall, taking risks could turn out to be a loss in the short term, but it is greatly outweighed by all the upsides taking a risk could bring.",,,,,,7.0,"In recent years, there has been much discussion about what a country's primary goal should be, with many governments arguing that economic development is the most crucial target. They often believe that boosting the economy leads to more jobs, better infrastructure, and a higher standard of living for everyone, as seen in countries like China, which has experienced rapid growth in recent decades and lifted millions out of poverty. However, some people argue that focusing solely on economic progress can result in neglecting other important aspects, such as social equality, education, or environmental sustainability. For example, countries with high GDP growth can still face serious problems with pollution or lack of quality healthcare. In my opinion, while economic growth is necessary for providing citizens with a stable and prosperous life, it should not be pursued alone. A well-rounded approach that also invests in education, healthcare, and environmental protection ensures long-term prosperity and happiness for the population.

They might working hard for live but they must have no time to think about other goal. This is reason why the governments to develop social economic . it is not uncommon that government have no money to solve the problem that environment pollution and others.

For example, when poor countries focus on growing their economies, they can help millions of people escape poverty. However, other types of progress are also important, such as making sure people have access to education, protecting the environment, and ensuring equal rights for everyone. If governments only focus on making money, sometimes they might damage nature or ignore people's needs. In my opinion, a good government should try to balance these goals.

The benefits of economic growth include higher average incomes. Economic growth enables consumer to consume more goods and services and enjoy better standards of living.
The economic progress is an important goal for governments, because firstly, a healthy economy results in job creations, a high level of employment, and better salaries for all citizens. Secondly, economic progress ensures that more money is available for governments to spend on infrastructure and public services.
Another progress is important for a country, in my point of view, technical progress or technology in general is very important for a country, in many bases.
The technological progress refers to the discovery of new and improved methods of producing goods.
The term process technology refers to chemical processing used to refine raw materials into finished products. For example, process technology is used to refine crude oil.
Technological prosperity also lies in global purposes, so for military purposes and war technique, are important in terms of preparation and possessing advanced weapons.
And also for local and domestic or personal purposes, for example use of modern devices, and networks of the fifth generation ( 5G ).

first of all, it is widely believed that increase in gross domestic product is related to economic growth, which governments also think is their main aim to focus on. This in other terms lead to an good export and import trading. For example, an imported product is more expensive when compared with native product in terms of quality and manufacturing, where more money is invested by government. Therfore, governments main focus shouldn't be only on economy.

However, there are people who believe that there could be some health concerns by living in big cities. This could be ture to some extent, but I do not agree compeletely with this openion.
One of the biggest health concern could come form air polutions, as big cities likely to have heavy trafics, especially in the third would coutries. However, in the developed coutries, many cities have as same amonut of trafics as suburban areas, or evern less. For example, many big cities in developed coutries charges a lot for parkings. This will encourage people to commute by public transportations. As a result, you could see less cars on the road in the cities.
There are also a health concerns coming from having less exercise. However, usually, ther are many gyms in the city. Also, many cities tend to have a big park or walking track, wher people can go for walks and jogs.
However, I agree that people living outside the cities, especialy wher surrounded by natures will have more cleaner air. Also having more space to exercise, compare to people living in cities may assist in being able to maintain their health.

One main concern is the poor air quality that is common in most big cities, as traffic congestion and high numbers of vehicles lead to more air pollution, which can cause respiratory problems over time. For instance, I have a cousin who developed asthma after moving to a busy city where the air was often filled with smog. Additionally, noise pollution from crowded streets and ongoing construction can lead to stress and trouble sleeping, both of which affect overall health. On the other hand, big cities often offer greater access to hospitals, clinics, and fitness centers, making it easier for people to take care of their health if they choose to. In my experience, living in a city has allowed me to join a gym that I visit regularly, which helps me stay active. In conclusion, while living in big cities can lead to certain health issues due to pollution and stress, there are also benefits like better healthcare and facilities for exercise, so I believe the effect on health depends largely on individual choices and the specific city environment."

While some people believe that the availability of resources and welfare in metropolises can outweigh the unhealthy environment, I strongly believe that the fancy infrastructures come in exchange for health sacrifice.
To begin with, most megacities are overpopulated. With scarce resources and higher demands in every aspect, products and services received in these bustling locations usually come at a higher price, lower quality and longer waiting time. For example, it could take up to weeks or months to queue up for non-urgent medical services while it takes only a few days or even without booking in non-busy areas. Moreover, the nature of crowded areas accelerates the spreading of transmittable diseases during the pandemic.
Another undeniable health factor for those residing in cities is pollution. Most cities come with traffic issues where there are exceeding amounts of cars which create air pollution. It is proved that, in long term, smog in the air could result in respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. Furthermore, the number of the city's population is equal to the extremely large amount of waste and without an appropriate waste management system, it could lead to several more problems. One of them is pests such as mice and bugs which are the perfect mediums for severe diseases such as rabies.
All in all, urbanization has tremendous benefits to human society as a whole and is unavoidable in the present context. Thus, governments should focus on addressing these issues to ensure the sustainable progress of cities and the citizens' quality of life.",,,,,,7.5,"It is often argued that living in large urban areas may have negative impacts on people’s health, and to a large extent, I agree with this viewpoint. One major reason is the significant air and noise pollution associated with city life. For example, in many major cities such as Bangkok or Beijing, smog from millions of vehicles and factories hangs over the streets, increasing the risk of respiratory problems for residents. Additionally, the fast-paced lifestyle and constant rush can lead to higher stress levels, which may contribute to anxiety and sleep disorders. Limited access to nature and green spaces is another factor; many city dwellers rarely enjoy outdoor activities, which can decrease both physical and mental well-being. While cities may offer advanced medical facilities, the sheer number of residents often means long wait times and overburdened healthcare systems. Nevertheless, it is true that urban centers can provide better employment and education opportunities, but I believe these benefits sometimes come at the expense of public health. In conclusion, I agree that while big cities offer numerous advantages, the risks they pose to people’s health are considerable and should not be overlooked."

However, some people consider that the life in big cities is generally hazardous for the health of people. In my opinion, although big cities provide many amenities to the people but the city life is not good for a person when it comes to health.
The main reason is continuous increase in population. Metropolitan cities attract people from small towns and/or villages in search of better opportunities, good education for their children or medical facilities. This migration makes these cities overcrowded. As population increases, there will be many vehicles on roads. More traffic will lead to more air and noise pollution. Likewise, as the population increases, the demand for housing also will escalate. To fulfill the demand of housing, local government has to reduce the green space to built more buildings in the city which will lead to more pollution. Obviously, pollution causes many health issues.
Another reason is stressful and busy life in the big cities. People working in big MNC companies in the cities, have deadlines to complete their work. If they are not able to meet the deadlines, it will affect their growth in the company. People in metropolitan cities are so busy that they don't have time to take care of their health. Living in a continuous stress without taking care of the health leads to many health problems.
To conclude, the life in a big city is very stressful, busy and surrounded with a lot of pollution, which is not good for health of an individual.",,,,,,7.5,"Some people argue that living in major cities is detrimental to people’s health, and I largely agree with this opinion due to several compelling reasons. One of the main issues is pollution from vehicles and factories, which is often much higher in urban areas than in the countryside. Breathing polluted air can cause serious respiratory problems and even increase the risk of heart disease. In addition, noise pollution from traffic and construction can disrupt sleep and elevate stress levels, making it difficult for city dwellers to maintain good mental and physical health. Another concern is the fast-paced and hectic lifestyle common in big cities. Most people work long hours and spend a lot of time commuting, leaving little time for exercise or preparing healthy meals. For example, some of my relatives who moved to a large city for better job opportunities now complain they barely have time for family or relaxation, which has led to high blood pressure and constant fatigue. Although big cities offer advanced medical care and entertainment options, the harmful effects of pollution, stress, and limited access to nature outweigh these benefits in my opinion. Therefore, I believe that living in big cities generally poses more risks to health compared to life in smaller towns or villages."

However, when it comes to whether living in a metropolis would do bad to people’s health, individuals hold different views. As far as I am concerned, it does diminish individuals’ health conditions.
Undoubtedly, living in a metropolis has some benefits for the inhabitants’ health. A big city is more likely to provide individuals with high level medical services which can be helpful when people are afflicted with various diseases. Precisely, there are numerous community clinics as well as large hospitals where individuals can get access to offering people the most advanced medical technology and medicines. Thus, greater recovering possibilities are provided by big cities for sick people.
However, urban life can also be unhealthy due to numerous reasons. Firstly, individuals tend to suffer from greater mental stress in a metropolis. Specifically, the increasingly higher housing price contributes to the heavy financial burdens of individuals. People are compelled to struggle with high-intensity works due to the high cost in housing, which would cause a high mental pressure. Besides, one of the reasons for individuals’ mental pressure can be the indifferent relationship among urban inhabitants which is caused by the lack of a sense of community.
Furthermore, the poor air condition which is caused by the remorseless rush of pollution in big cities does do harm to citizens’ health conditions. For instance, the waste gas that discharged by the cars in the streets and the factories is polluting the air in urban areas, leading to a higher rate in diseases. As a result, citizens’ health conditions can be diminished physically.
In conclusion, although a metropolis can provide advanced medical services to urban inhabitants, living in big cities can also be hazardous to individuals’ mental heath and body health due to numerous factors. In my opinion, living in a metropolis is more likely to undermine people’s health.",,,,,,7.5,"The issue of whether residing in large urban areas is detrimental to people’s health has always sparked heated discussions. From my perspective, the negative impacts tend to outweigh the advantages. It is undeniable that big cities typically feature superior healthcare facilities, with a large number of modern hospitals and medical professionals, which means that residents can seek timely and efficient treatment for a range of illnesses. Such access to advanced care does improve health outcomes to some extent. Nevertheless, city life brings with it a host of health hazards. For one thing, air pollution in metropolises is notoriously severe due to the high density of automobiles and industrial activity. I have personally experienced frequent coughing and discomfort during days when the air quality index is particularly poor, and many urban dwellers suffer similarly from respiratory issues. Moreover, the fast-paced lifestyle often leads to chronic stress, as people face fierce competition for jobs and endure long commutes. This constant pressure can result in anxiety and even depression, which are increasingly prevalent in urban settings. Lastly, limited green spaces and crowded living conditions might discourage physical exercise and foster unhealthy eating habits, thus contributing to obesity and related illnesses. In conclusion, despite some health-related conveniences of metropolitan living, the overall threats to both mental and physical well-being make big city life more harmful to health in the long run."

In my humble opinion, I consider big-city life to be harmful.
A row of arguments can prove this point of view. The air and water pollution in cities tend to provoke a spectrum of lung and skin diseases. A number of people encountering lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, eczema and psoriasis prevails in megapolicies compared to small towns and villages. Even I have acquired chronic bronchitis while leaving in Moscow. It also must be mentioned that constant contamination of enviroment has long-term consequence for human genetics. For instance, several decades ago the phenomena of allergy was not so widespread. And nowadays, several hundred thousands of people are suffering from it, as their immune system responds inadequately to ordinary things, such as animal fur or dust.
On the contrary, the medicine level in small villages cannot be compared with medicine in large cities. Some urgent problems such as limb break, infection, serious inflammation, heart attack, seizures or appendicits can be tackled only in large cities, where you can call an ambulance and it will come in a blink of an eye, while in countyside it can cause a dramatical outcome. My friend's grandpa in a distant village broke a rib and it stabbed his lung, and, unfortunately, ambulance did not make it in time.
To sum up, living in megapolice can possibly extend your life, but for me the quality of this life is still doubtful.",,,,,,6.5,"The question of whether residing in large cities negatively affects health is a topic that many people debate. Personally, I believe that urban living can indeed be detrimental to well-being for several important reasons. First of all, the chronic air and noise pollution found in big cities exposes residents to harmful substances and high stress levels, contributing to respiratory issues such as asthma and anxiety-related disorders like insomnia. For instance, when I visited a relative in Beijing, I noticed myself coughing much more often, despite only being there for two weeks. Furthermore, the fast pace of city life often leads to poor eating habits and lack of physical activity, since people rely on convenience foods and have limited access to green spaces for exercise. Still, there are advantages to city life, such as quick access to state-of-the-art hospitals and highly qualified doctors, which can sometimes mitigate the health risks associated with urban environments. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the overall lifestyle and environmental drawbacks outweigh the medical benefits. In conclusion, while living in a large city does offer better healthcare facilities, the day-to-day exposure to pollutants and the stress of modern urban life make it less than ideal for maintaining good health."

There is also an increase in pollution due to the high density of people, cars and other carbon immisions.

For example, people in big cities have access to advanced hospitals, specialists, and healthcare facilities, which can often mean earlier diagnosis and better treatment for illnesses. The city also often provides a variety of health-related services like gyms, parks, and mental health support, which can encourage a healthy lifestyle if people make the effort to use them. From my own experience, while living in a rural area gave me access to cleaner air, it was difficult to find a doctor quickly when I needed one.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Despite to the presence of vast amount of translation programs on computers and other electronic devices, it is still considered more beneficial in terms of learning language itself. In this essay, I will be describing my total agreement with this dilemma.
The utmost reason for learning new language instead of using various programs is that human brain makes necessary changes in its structure and produces necessary chemical substances which in turn gives other functions to the brain. As a result of this human brain gains new functions in addition to the language skills.
Another benefit coming from directly learning language is the opportunity to express your beliefs and emotions in that language which is impossible to realize via software programs. People around the speaker tend to understand the spoken language more easily and get the speaker's ultimate goal in a more usual and humane way.
The third reason for studying the language rather than carrying a software to translate might be the possibility of immediately using language. In other words, software programs can not find the right words according to the situations or conversations among people. As a consequence of this, due to different meanings which translation devices remain useless in such cases, huge misunderstandings can occur.
In a conclusion, in addition to the reasons mentioned above, using language by learning it always seems realiable and more realistic way than using device for this purpose. As I raised my pure opinion toward gaining language skill earlier I strongly believe that this method has been the most preferable method for decades and it will be.",,,,,,7.0,"While translation software has become increasingly advanced and widespread, I firmly believe that learning a language remains highly beneficial. One important reason for this is that direct knowledge of a language deepens cultural understanding and allows individuals to participate more fully in the customs and traditions of native speakers. For example, software may give the literal translation of an idiom or joke, but often misses the intended meaning or humor, making genuine communication difficult. Furthermore, people who know the language can react instantly in conversations and build personal connections, which is especially necessary in situations needing empathy, like making new friends or handling emergencies. Another reason is that the process of learning a language helps improve memory and cognitive skills, providing lifelong advantages beyond just speaking to others. Additionally, translation software is not always available or accurate, particularly for less common languages or in places without internet access, so personal language skills are reliable in more situations. Therefore, despite the help translation tools provide, I totally agree that the personal, social, and mental benefits of mastering a language make it far more advantageous."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Some people claim that language knowledge has still benefited inspite of appearance of applications and websites providing translation in real time. Modern special software is able to give quite quality translation into different languages, and it seems that it will soon replace the translators and will get rid of necessity to learn new languages. However, in my opinion, there are still some essential advantages to know foreign languages.
First of all, any language is so complicated and constantly changing system that it is impossible to automized translation process to keep all senses. For instance, if you interlocutor creates a joke based on words game, it will unlikely recognise by AI. Thus, it is too hard to teach a computer to uderstand all meanings that you want to provide.
Another important aspect of learning languages is knowing new cultures. Language is the great source for understanding other nations and countries. If you use online translator, you will never know the origine of some idioms or phrases that contain culture code.
Moreover, learning new language is a tool of training your brain. It helps to develop memory and imagination. For instance, people didn't refuse studying maths after calculation device had been invented, because it is still important to understand how it works and it is necessary for developing other sciences.
Finally, there is a lot of places and occasions when you do not have internet access. Then online translators are not available. But if you need help or ask a path being abroad, it is better to know at least some phrases. Otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.
To sum up, I definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress.

However, I strongly believe that learning a language still holds significant advantages compared to relying only on translation technologies. Firstly, language is more than a tool for communication; it carries feelings, ideas, and cultural backgrounds. Translation programs often fail to translate the emotional meaning or humour correctly, especially when unique sayings or slang are used. For example, if someone uses a proverb or a phrase common in their country, the translation might not make sense, and the listener can misunderstand the whole point. Furthermore, when a person learns a new language, they also discover traditions, values, and ways of thinking different from their own, which strengthens their understanding of global cultures and encourages open-mindedness. Additionally, learning a language improves our memory and thinking abilities, as it exercises the brain in unique ways, just like solving puzzles or playing strategy games. Also, translation software is dependent on technology, so in situations with no internet or in places where devices are unavailable, knowing the local language is much more useful. In conclusion, while translation software is a helpful tool, I believe that language learning is essential for deeper communication, cultural appreciation, and personal development."

Owing to limited usefulness of translation softwares in daily life, to large extent, ı agree with this statement. However, educationalists may use these programmes as supporting management systems for academical purposes.
A growing number of softwares are available on online platforms to help people for translating documents or improve their language skills. Individuals from different sociocultural or educational levels frequently utilise these open-access and easily understandable operating systems. Moreover, some teachers recommend their use to promote the learning process of primary school pupils. Last but not least, because translating a sheet by using these programmes is less time-consuming and free of charge, its use is gaining popularity among young individuals with regard to academic communication and correspondence.
On the other hand, the utility of these file management systems are questioned by some experts in the field of philology. Some linguistic scientists stated that translation supporting systems distracts children’s motivation and eagerness to learn the grammatical rules of a language.

From my point of view, softwares should not be introduced to children before learning basics of a language and gaining an intermedicate level of spoken and written vocabulary.

For example, when traveling or living abroad, being able to hold natural conversations with locals or respond appropriately to unexpected situations is something that automated software cannot always manage effectively. Furthermore, people who learn new languages tend to improve their cognitive abilities, such as memory and problem-solving skills, which translation software cannot provide. It is also worth noting that employers in many fields value genuine language skills, as they indicate adaptability and a willingness to embrace diverse cultures, rather than just relying on digital tools.

However, in my opinion, learning a new language might be more advantageous than using this software.
First of all, the process of learning new languages involves the ability to correspond words in two different dialects, which also requires using a lot of parts of our brain. Therefore, this process improves certain areas of our neurologic system, specifically, the left hemisphere, responsible for communication and speech.
In fact, multiple studies have shown that people that speak different idioms have a lower risk of neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer's and Dementia since the left side of the brain is more developed than others that might only know one language.
Furthermore, these types of software are not always accurate. In spite of being correct the majority of the time, there are some situations where the translation is wrong because of different factors.
One of them is that there's no translation for certain words in other languages, for example, ""Saudade"" in Portuguese has no correspondence in English.
Besides that, when using Google Translate one has to pay attention to the translation given in certain languages. In reality, when translating from English to Portuguese, sometimes the programme doesn't consider the fact that in Portuguese adjectives come after the noun while in English they came before.
Lastly, someone that chooses to use this type of system to communicate with someone, instead of learning that language loses a bigger amount of time than others that already speak that dialect. That is because one has to first record what the person is saying then tell the software their answer and wait for it to be translated to the other. This results in a quite complicated setting that might be aggravated in situations where the translator doesn't understand one of the persons involved in the conversation.
To illustrate this, when talking to the AI ""Siri"" on the iPhone or ""Alexa"" on Google, a lot of the time they don't comprehend what we are saying, which results in people having to repeat themselves several times.

In fact, this not only boosts our knowledge but also avoids difficult situations where what people are trying to say is wrongly translated.",,,,,,8.0,"It is clear that advancements in translation technology have made it easier for people to communicate across language barriers, but I strongly believe that learning a new language remains much more beneficial. Firstly, knowing a second language allows individuals to express themselves more naturally and deeply, picking up on cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions that translation software often overlooks. For example, when I traveled to Japan, I noticed that simple greetings could change meaning depending on the time of day and the relationship between speakers—differences that apps like Google Translate rarely handle correctly. Additionally, language learning has cognitive benefits, as it challenges the brain to think in new ways, improving memory and problem-solving skills, which no translation tool can offer. Moreover, most software can struggle with slang or context-specific language, sometimes leading to embarrassing mistakes or confusion, especially in professional environments. While translation tools are helpful for quick understanding, relying solely on them can create dependency and limit meaningful connections with others. Therefore, I agree that despite the convenience of translation software, acquiring a new language still provides substantial personal, cultural, and mental advantages that technology cannot fully replace."

I certainly agree that the benefits of acquiring a new language still outweigh that of using translation apps because it is a systematic learning and it is able to improve your competitiveness rather than rely on translating tools.
To learn a language, we must start form vocabulary and grammar then goes to the process of making up a sentence. In the initial stage it would be difficult to master the pronounciation but once you overcome this part, you are actually acquire the skills of using a foreign language naturally. Moreover, through the learning process, you are trying to gain permanent memory of it which won't let you forget the spelling of a word so soon. For example, language laerners usually perform well in certain areas such as academic or business field via lots of practices and trainings and they attribute to their hardwork instead of translating tools.
Using translation software is not a bad thing and the fact is they are available in these days yet heavy reliance on it can not bring you as much benefits as learning languages step by step. I can not deny that these tools are convenient and easy to use, however it may restrict our level of learning outcome from it function- translating word by word, which is usually lead to the result of wrong meaning of a sentence.

The result is that they are underperforming because lack of training and unable to interprete the definition of words.

Therefore, the benefits of language learning go far beyond the convenience of translation software, making it a valuable skill in today’s interconnected world."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Learning a language seems to be an advantage even though there are plenty of translation softwares can be accessed to in this era. I certainly agree that the benefits of acquiring a new language still outweigh that of using translation apps because it is a systematic learning and it is able to improve your competitiveness rather than rely on translating tools.
To learn a language, we must start form vocabulary and grammar then goes to the process of making up a sentence. In the initial stage it would be difficult to master the pronounciation but once you overcome this part, you are actually acquire the skills of using a foreign language naturally. Moreover, through the learning process, you are trying to gain permanent memory of it which won't let you forget the spelling of a word so soon. For example, language laerners usually perform well in certain areas such as academic or business field via lots of practices and trainings and they attribute to their hardwork instead of translating tools.
Using translation software is not a bad thing and the fact is they are available in these days yet heavy reliance on it can not bring you as much benefits as learning languages step by step. I can not deny that these tools are convenient and easy to use, however it may restrict our level of learning outcome from it function- translating word by word, which is usually lead to the result of wrong meaning of a sentence. Many learners, on the other hand trying to translating every text while they are reading an article, it may be useful to conquer the hardships initially, but in the long run they may forget all the contents since they are not memorize the meanings of a word and just let it go after the reading. The result is that they are underperforming because lack of training and unable to interprete the definition of words.
To summarize, I agree that learning a language still can be advantegeous than just simply searching for the translation by apps no matter how convenient the tools are. Once you really learn something and internalize into your life, than you are able to being outstanding than those who are not.",,,,,,6.0,"Even though translation software has become increasingly advanced and accessible, I strongly believe that learning a new language remains highly beneficial. Acquiring a language is much more than just translating words; it involves understanding cultural nuances, idioms, and the context in which people communicate. For instance, people who have taken the time to properly learn another language often find it easier to connect with locals when traveling or doing business abroad, which can open up a wealth of opportunities that machines simply cannot provide. While translation apps can help in basic communication, they often mistranslate slang or complex expressions, leading to misunderstandings and confusion. Additionally, learning a new language can improve cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills, as it challenges your brain and broadens your perspective. For example, students who study foreign languages tend to perform better in other subjects, as they become more adept at switching between different types of thinking. Therefore, although translation technology is useful, the deeper advantages of language learning—such as personal growth and cross-cultural understanding—make it a far more valuable skill in the long run."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Translation softwares are a convenience that we see popping up more and more around us these days. I have seen these being used in daily life around me even very recently. For example, I was recently at the airport to travel from the east coast to the west coast of the US. While there, a passenger in line before me at the luggage drop off had his phone out and was talking to the attendants using his phone. On paying closer attention I realized, he was using a translation software to understand what they said and to respond back to them. It took some effort on both sides, but in the end, it worked!
This is a real-life example of translation software making peoples' lives easier on a regular basis. Witnessing this got me thinking - what would have happened in the absence of this service being available literally on the tips of our fingers. In the absence of this easy access to technology as we have today however, it has come down to one thing - the human capacity to learn and communicate in more than one language.
Coming from a multicultural background where none of my neighbors spoke the same language as me, it was inevitable that I would be exposed to multiple languages since childhood. This is a reality for most metropolitan cities around the world. When I was three years old and could communicate to some degree in my mother tongue or native language, my father ensured I also learned another one of our National languages that was prevalent in the region. By the time I was six-seven years old, I could conveniently speak in two languages. Meanwhile, in school, I was being exposed to the English alphabet in addition to the two other languages which made it easy to learn and understand English too. I can categorically say that knowing all three languages made my life infinitely easier for me since we moved around a lot due to my father's work arrangements.
Later on, during my college days, I met my best friend of eighteen years and was exposed to her native language or mother tongue and since then have picked up a passing knowledge of the language as well. The movies and plays around us while young used multiple languages too and as a result I have a passing knowledge of six languages today. This knowledge not only makes communicating a breeze for me in most areas in my country, it keeps my brain active.
In conclusion, I believe while translation softwares definitely make life easier for us on different occasions, being bilingual, trilingual, or a polyglot serves to make life interesting and easy at the same time. Truly understanding and speaking a language brings to light so many nuanced facets of an entire culture surrounding the language which cannot be translated through a translation software. It has been proven that learning multiple languages helps keep the human brain adaptable and flexible - all marks of a young and active mind. From my personal experiences, I believe that the translation softwares serve as a quick solution to the language barrier for people in general, learning a language brings in a level of richness to ones experience of life as a whole. Translations softwares should therefore not be considered as a replacement for learning a language but as an aide to learning a new skill.",,,,,,7.5,"In today’s world, there is no shortage of translation software at our disposal, and I have seen many people rely on them for quick communication in various places. For instance, just last week at a local coffee shop, I watched as a tourist used an app on his phone to order a complicated drink from a barista who did not speak his language. It was impressive to see the interaction go smoothly, reminding me of how far technology has come in bridging language gaps. However, witnessing this also made me reflect on the depth of understanding that only comes with actually learning a language. Growing up in an immigrant household, my parents emphasized the value of preserving our native language alongside English, encouraging me to speak both at home and in school. This dual-language upbringing offered me unique insights not just into words themselves, but also into the humor, traditions, and cultural references that translation tools often miss. When I traveled abroad during high school, I found that simple exchanges—like jokes, idioms, or even local slang—were lost on translation apps, sometimes leading to misunderstandings or missed connections. On the other hand, being able to speak and think in another language allowed me to make deeper friendships and navigate daily life with more confidence. Beyond practicality, research shows that bilingual individuals often benefit from better cognitive flexibility and memory retention compared to monolingual speakers. All in all, while translation software provides an incredible convenience in breaking initial barriers and easing travel or business situations, I strongly believe that learning a language enriches one’s life in ways technology cannot replicate. It is not only about speaking with others; it is about understanding perspectives, appreciating traditions, and cultivating a mindset open to lifelong learning. Therefore, I think translation tools are best viewed as supportive companions on the journey, but the true rewards come from making the effort to learn a new language oneself."

Some argue that routine behavior is adequate for spending their life, by others do not agree with this thought. This essay will attempt to provide a brief analysis.
First of all, it is a fact that people feel comfortable to being and doing things that they being familiar with, by fixing routine in every day we can make our life certain and manageable. For example, working in the same company for many years not only make a sustainable income but also become more expert in this working field. This helps people to reduce the risk of facing things we not prefer.
However, all of the creatures has to develop and adapt to an environment to survive in this crucial world and not even human, this important for us to leave our comfort zone in some situation. Encouraging new challenges in life could give us to develop and explore new skills or new ways of thought. From my experience, I recently tried to play a new sport that I never thought I will in love with, which is golf. It is the kind of sport I never play in my life, I am not only got a new way of enjoyment of this sport, but also bring me to know a ton of new quality friends I got from the golf society. This event can lift my life quality to another level I did not expected before.

For example, my uncle has worked at the same job for over twenty years, and he finds comfort in knowing what to expect every day. On the other hand, others believe that embracing change is essential for growth and happiness. Taking on new experiences, such as moving to a new city or learning a new language, can open doors to unexpected opportunities and personal development. From my perspective, while routine can provide stability, positive change is important because it challenges us and can lead to a more fulfilling life. I recently joined a volunteer program that was different from anything I had done before, and it allowed me to meet new people and learn valuable skills.

Some people think, that is it important to change our daily life. Conversely, other thinks that does not matter at all and, do not want to change. In my point of view, I think it is difficult to change. However, we have a lot of environmental issues last decade, therefore, we need to change.
Learn new habits and to try new places is difficult as we get older. So, if people arrive to create a meaningful and happyness life, I think it could be counterproductive to change. For instance, if you have a good salary, a beautifull place to live and a lovely family, it is not important to search other things. Cause of, the most important feature of life is to be happy.
On the other hand, the human nature is to evolve. I think, adaptation to his own environment is crucial for deal with the recents climate. Moreover, if we stop to learn new behaviour, we could not be able to adapt sharply for the global warming. For example, one solution about the global warming is to learn news behaviours and habits. That can help to reduce smog and, as we know, our brain are plastic, but if we do not use it, it will stop to work.

My friend, for instance, wants to travel to new places and always tries different activities, which helps her to grow as a person. I believe that even though change can be frightening, it is important to sometimes try new things to keep life interesting and to learn more about ourselves and the world. Without change, we might miss out on opportunities for personal growth and happiness, but it is also important not to force changes when we already feel content. Overall, both opinions have value, and I think it is best to find a balance between enjoying stability and being open to new experiences."

Some people are probably afraid of change and for this reason they prefer staying in the confort zone because it's something familiar. On the other hand, others believe that change is a good opportunity to grow and discover new things.
Changing it's not for everybody, because there are people that doesn't like it, so they try to avoid it. Spending the whole life doing the same thing is not as bad as change for some people. This is probably linked to the fact that sometime change is something unknown. So, sometime people prefere to stay in their confort zone because even if it's not the best at least is something familiar. For example, people that hate their jobs but are stuck with it, is because they're too afraid to change it and land in a worse place or position. So they rather stay in that place because they're too afraid to lose it and end up worse. I believe that this is an understandable and common reason around people, however i believe that change can give more chances for improvement.
Other people believes that change is always a positive thing. Changing is an opportunity to grow and discover new things, It's a chance to achieve something better and improve. There are people who doesn't like to be in the same place (phisically, economically or emotionally) and prefer changing. For instance, going to a new country because the idea of living in the same place forever is not charming enough, so find out new places to see, and places to feel confortable ,emotionally and economically for instance, is something that only people who are hungry enough of change would do it. I believe that sometime it's better risk it than live the same life everyday.
In conclusion, the preference about change depends on people and wheter is beneficial or not depends on the different point of views and situations.

Students of today are the proffessionals of tomorrow and thus is very important they recibe a propper education. In my opinion we should divide students based on their academic ability.
If we educate all students together regarthless of their different academic abilities we will be making a hughe mistake. Students with higher capacities will not be adressed in a propper way and it will discourage them. Smart students tend to get bored very fast and therefore special attention must be pay to them.
On the contrary, if we educate students based on their academic abilities we will not only see better results in the smarter ones, but we will also take better care of the students with more learning difficulties. By using this method the needs of the students will be adressed in a better way.
Education should have an indiviudal focus or at least in different groups, taking academic abilities degrees in account.
In my personal expirience I shared classrooms with students that had special needs and teachers educate them in different ways than the rest of as. These special students have different learning times and needed more atenttion from their teachers. On the other hand, some students were very smart with great academic abilities and some of them had some behaviour troubles becouse they got bored at class, I remmember one student named Jackson Bell who was brilliant and was sent to the school physicologist due to behaviour problems(he hit other students) and if teachers have gaived Jackson the extra attention he needed that wouldn´t happen.",,,,,,6.0,"There are many debates about the most effective way to organize students in schools, especially when it comes to their academic ability. Some people believe dividing students by this factor helps them learn more efficiently, since they can get instruction that matches their needs. Others think every student should be taught together, because mixing abilities teaches cooperation and prevents anyone from feeling left out. In my view, separating students by ability may give the best results for everyone. On one hand, teaching all students together can support those who struggle, as advanced students can help them, and everyone gets the same opportunities. However, this often causes problems: advanced students may not be challenged and become bored, while struggling students feel frustrated trying to keep up. From my own experience, I noticed that in mixed classes some talented students would not pay attention or would disturb others because the lessons were too easy, while some students always needed more time and support. When I attended after-school tutoring that split us into groups based on our skill level, everyone was more focused, and people improved faster. For these reasons, I believe grouping students according to their academic ability is a better approach, as it helps each student learn at a pace and level that suits them."

According to some, it should be better to separate students based on their academic skills, while others believe that a valid education can be transmitted without discriminating people based on their ability.
People that support the separation of students believe that an omogeneous group can learn better and faster. Indeed, if someone has less skills compared to the others component of the group, teachers have two possibilities. First, to lower the level of the lessons in order to allow a catch up. Second, leave behind the student wiht low ability. Both solutions are not optimals. Thus, if we put together students with similar capabilities, we can make the process of learing more efficent for both groups.
The other vision is to educate students all together. By doing so, you can encourage low skills students to engage theirselves to catch up with the most brilliant one. Moreover, if you split the group, students with less capabilities can develop self-estimation problems and so, they will think that they can not be in the ""best"" group. Another good point for educate all students together is that people with higher ability will help their classmates. However, the level of the class will be probably lower.
To conclude, I think that the best solution depends on the purpose of the educator and on the age of students. Indeed, it is very differet the education of children or teenagers.

For example, advanced students can be challenged with more complex material, while those who need extra support can learn at a slower pace without feeling rushed. On the other hand, those who oppose this idea argue that mixed classes foster a sense of community and cooperation, allowing students to learn from one another. They point out that separating students may harm the confidence of those placed in lower groups and can increase feelings of inequality in the classroom. From my own experience, studying in mixed-ability classes helped me develop patience and empathy because everyone worked together, and stronger students often helped those struggling.

The other says that it is no object who a better in education who not they should study together. I believe that it is terrible idea to include separation among students.
On the one hand, when students with strong and weak academic abilities educate separately, teachers could control the learning process more thoroughly. In this way the teacher could give them more difficult tasks and focus on really relevant topics. A good example of this are private schools with fees and entering exams. It is the fact that there students in final classes have better knowledge than in common schools.
On the other hand, when students with different skills educate together the strong students will help weak ones. In these classes there are standards and all students should follow them and there are opportunities to ask schoolmates how to solve some task correctly. The nice example of this is my school. If I did not know how to solve a task I would have a chance to wait for help from my more wise mate.
In conclusion, although separate education will give a chance to learn a lot of difficult tasks and it helps teachers, the losing way of asking help if you do not know how to solve the task would be devastating for the educational process.

Students that are divided based upon their academic ability are more likely to learn specific parts of their subjects. This will help students not only to learn more but also help them gain more confidence so that they can believe in themselves and so that they are more likely to understand the information required by their subject as they are recieving extra help.
However if students are divided according to their academic ability they are more likely to feel bored as they may not have their peers to interact with and there's also a high chance that the students may feel isolated as they believe they feel like they do not have the knowledge requirements for their subjects which can demotivate the students and further leading to poor grades.
If students are educated together they can feel like that their not left out and they can help recieve information from their peers which can help them further understand the subject.
However if the students are educated together there's a high chance that they are more likely to be distracted by their peers and they would be less focused on their subjects which can lead too poor grades. Morever if students are educated together there's also a chance that specific students may not understand what the teacher is teaching or talking about as diffrerent students have different understandings and academic abilities.
Overall I believe students should be divided according to their academic abilities this is because students are more likely to understand the information provided by their teachers as they are provided with additional support and students should be more mature enought to undertsand that if they do not meet specific academic requirements they should not be demotivated, they should understand how to handle the situation and show that they can be courageous enough to do even better as the students are provided with additional support.",,,,,,7.5,"Some people think that dividing students by their academic ability is the best choice because it allows teachers to focus on the specific needs of each group.

This can lead to better results overall, as every student can learn at the pace that fits them best. However, there are drawbacks to this method, such as students feeling judged or being separated from friends, which might lower their confidence or make them feel left out. On the other hand, teaching all students together can build a stronger sense of community and allow students of different abilities to help each other. This can be very motivating and teach important social skills. Yet, it also means some students may struggle to keep up, while others might get bored.

Some individuals argue that minors should be taught separately based on their academic performance, whereas others state that they ought to be educated together. This essay will discuss both viewpoints, although it is my opinion that it is better to allocate students together regardless of their capabilities.
Proponents of the idea of dividing children at different levels argue that the selection can better facilitate an efficient and productive learning environment for different students. More specifically, by doing so, schools can provide specific objectives to meet students’ needs as young people have distinctiveness in learning preferences, personalities, and interests. Therefore, through selecting and separating the youth into a range of classes based on their talents and intelligence, schools cannot only tailor a result-oriented syllabus to explore each student’s maximum potential but also improve the quality of education since excellent students can learn in a fast way without anyone being left behind. In contrast, ordinary students can still keep up with the majority with complete comprehension. Furthermore, this can also minimise the possible pressure that some academically challenged students suffer from the negative psychological impacts, considering their poor performance in the exams or assignments.
Others, however, who point out that mixed classes attach great importance to the contribution of healthy competition and collaboration, also make valid arguments. Despite the possible imbalance in each student’s academic performance in a class, superior peers can serve as a desirable role models to others. Their strengths, such as learning attitudes and methods, can enlighten the rest of the class to improve and study. In addition, the diversity in class can promote mutual study among children with different abilities and create a better environment for children’s all-rounded development. Since the way of streaming students has been proven effective and practical, this mode of teaching is highly advisable by educational experts, and there are still many schools following this norm to educate children rather than set them apart as many students who are not excellent at study may experience disappointment and a lack of confidence when compared to those straight-A students in separated classrooms.
In conclusion, although the teaching resources can be assigned more precisely to target youngsters’ gifts in the streaming, it is still too early and unfair at this stage. Therefore, I believe it is better to mix students with different levels of abilities in a dynamic and harmonious class, and undoubtedly, we should never discriminate unfairly against students who should be highly encouraged instead.",,,,,,8.0,"There is ongoing debate surrounding the question of whether students should be divided according to their academic ability or educated together, irrespective of performance. Supporters of separating students by ability believe this approach allows for more targeted teaching, as it acknowledges students’ varying learning speeds and needs. For instance, advanced learners can move through material faster and explore more challenging concepts, while those who need extra help receive the necessary attention and resources. Consequently, teachers can tailor lesson plans for each group, potentially leading to better learning outcomes for everyone involved. On the other hand, many advocate for educating all students together to foster inclusivity and social development. When students with different abilities learn side by side, they can help one another, promoting teamwork and empathy. Moreover, mixed-ability classrooms prevent the negative impacts of labeling students as ""weak"" or ""smart,"" which can damage self-esteem and motivation. From my own experience in a mixed classroom, I observed that collaboration encouraged personal growth and created a more supportive environment, benefiting both high achievers and those who struggled. In conclusion, while dividing students by ability may offer some academic advantages, I firmly believe that a unified classroom setting better equips students with essential social skills and emotional support, preparing them more effectively for life beyond school."

The main reason that people believe this, is because socialization with other children in school is viewed as being essential for the cognitive and social developement of children. The advantages of children attending school therefore consists of an improved social life with more friends their own age. This can help young children figure out how to navigate social situations better and improve their own self-image by receiving confirmation from their peers. Although there are a lot of advantages for children attending school, there are also a lot of disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that children don't get to spend a lot of time with their family. This can decrease the influence that parents have on their children in the long term and inable their ability to raise their children according to their own values.
The other less popular opinion is that it is better to teach your children at home rather than to send them off to school. The main reason that some people believe this, is because these parents are concerned that outside influences have the ability to disturb their childrens upbringing. The greatest advantage of homeschooling is that it promotes a better nuclear family and provides parents with more control concerning their childs upbringing. However, this schooling method comes with some disadvantages too, since childrens social developement can be hindered due to inatequate social interactions with children their own age.
In conclusion, I believe that it is best for childrens developement to be taught at school, rather than parents teaching their children at home. I hold this opinion since school attendance can enhance childrens social skills and their ability to navigate the world around them.",,,,,,7.0,"There are many differing views on whether homeschooling or sending children to school is better for a child's overall development. Some people argue that learning at home provides a more personalized education and allows parents to focus on their child's unique strengths and weaknesses. Homeschooling can be especially helpful for children who need extra attention or for families with specific beliefs or learning goals, as it allows them to structure the day in a way that suits their needs best. However, a significant number of people believe that attending school is more important, mainly because it exposes children to a wider range of experiences. One of the key advantages of school is that children learn how to socialize and cooperate with peers, which are important skills for both childhood and adulthood. In school, students also benefit from professional teachers and a more diverse curriculum, which can help them discover interests and talents they might not have explored at home. Although both methods have merits, I personally think that going to school is better for most children because it not only gives them access to more learning opportunities, but also teaches them how to work together with others. From what I have seen among my friends, those who went to school tend to have stronger social skills and a broader understanding of different perspectives."

While there are strong arguments in favour of teaching children at home, I still believe positive sides of going to school outweigh the opposite view.
On the one hand, there are obvious arguments why some people may prefer to teach their children at home. Children safety is the most common reason. Everyday way to and from school is a persistent danger for the younger generation as thousands of children become victims of the road accidents every year. Some other safety concerns include negligence of the teachers, while being stretched by the dozens of students, and criminal incidents such as mass shootings that are not so rare in the recent few years.
On the other hand, attendance of school provides learners with some essential social skills and help them to benchmark themselves versus their peers and subsequently to move forward. Interaction with people, work together on something and even competition in some aspects are key for future adjustment to the adult life. The recent study suggests that those primary school students that had started their education before the outbreak of the covid are on average show better results on various tests. Furthermore, education in the school tends to motivate most of the children via competition within the group.
In conclusion, there could be different opinions on whether teaching children at home is better than school education as there are certain advantages and drawbacks. I strongly believe that school education brings more benefits and couldn't be equally replaced by study at home",,,,,,7.0,"There are differing opinions regarding whether children should be taught at home or attend school for their development. Supporters of homeschooling often argue that personalized attention is a major strength, allowing children to progress at their own pace and focus on their interests, which can result in a deeper understanding of subjects. Moreover, learning in a home environment can protect children from negative influences such as bullying or peer pressure, and may provide a safer and more supportive setting for some families. However, advocates for traditional schooling emphasize the importance of socialization, noting that schools give children the opportunity to interact with others, learn teamwork, and understand how to resolve conflicts. These social skills are vital for success in adult life. School also exposes students to a variety of perspectives and ideas, and access to specialized facilities and resources like science labs and sports equipment can enhance learning. In my opinion, while homeschooling has its benefits for certain children, overall, attending school is crucial for the development of both academic knowledge and essential social abilities. Schools offer a broader educational experience that is difficult to replicate at home, preparing children more effectively for future challenges."

I think that sending children to school give them a great advantage not only in their academics but also in their development and social skills.
Having children at home and be their teacher is not easy. Although, it may be important for their development. A good side of home schooling, is the chance to be more connected with your own family and being able to manage your own time without having strict schedule. This means that you don't only have to study the subjects that are for example taught in school, but also it gives the children a chance to invest their time in activities in which they are interested in.
On the other hand, sending kids to school gives them the chance to interact more with other people and develop social skills. They have more opportunities to create connections and interactions with other students with the same age and also it might be considered more helpful to be in the same situation with others, so that they can learn to help each other.
However, in my personal experiece being in a class with a lot of students can be hard. Find the ""right people"" to be with might be challenging but at the end it is satisfying, because you might also end up having friends for life and creating good memories,
In conclusion, these two different methods are both acceptable, as long as the child best interest is done, no matter if his being teached at school or at home.",,,,,,6.5,"Many people think that homeschooling is the best way for children to grow, while others argue that attending school is essential for development. Homeschooling allows for a more flexible schedule and personalized attention, so children can learn at their own pace and focus on subjects they enjoy. For example, a child who is passionate about science might spend extra time doing experiments at home, which could help develop critical thinking skills. On the other hand, going to school helps children learn how to socialize and work with others. At school, students make friends, join clubs or sports, and learn how to solve problems as a team. In my view, while homeschooling offers great advantages, especially for children who need special support, being part of a school community is more important overall. From my own experience, attending school taught me not only about academic subjects, but also about understanding different people and building relationships, which are skills that are necessary throughout life. Therefore, while both methods have their strengths, I believe that going to school is the better choice for most children because of the benefits it provides both academically and socially."

Some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage. Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The topic of gay marriage merely failed to be discussed. However, when it comes to whether gay marriage should be allowed legally, individuals hold divergent views. As far as I am concerned, the government should treat gay marriage as a legal thing.
Undoubtedly, gay marriage can be beneficial. First of all, it is able to shrink the disparity between the affluent and the impoverished. For instance, some countries which allow gay marriage legally have become well-known tourism sites now by attracting foreign gays to come. Thus, their tourism industry can be thrived and the moribund local economy can be turned into the resurgent one, which may help to avoid turning the gap into gulf. Additionally, allowing gay marriage to be legal is also able to undermine the crime rate. On condition that some gays cannot enjoy the right of marriage, they may feel underrated, underprivileged and underappreciated, which may give them the predisposition to revenge the society to express their resentment and dissatisfaction. What is more, the government is able to diminish cultural conflict through making gay marriage a law. Provided that some individuals get little acquainted with gay culture, they may deem it as aggressive. However, by admitting it as a low, we can minimize such vulnerability and promote the mutual understanding of divergent cultures.
On the other hand, treating gay marriage legally also has various disadvantages. Firstly, it may undermine family rapport for the reason that some family members may not willing to accept gay marriage, which may cause the increasingly indifferent among family members and finally lead to family skirmish and splintering. In addition, some young individuals are possible to make mistakes at an early age if the government makes gay marriage law. It is widely acknowledged that some young people are not mature enough to choose the right partner. Provided that they get married at an early age, they may suffer irreversible loss.
To sum up, although there are some disadvantages to let gay marriage be legal, the benefits of it are multifaceted. Considering the development of the economy and culture, I agree with allowing gay marriage to be a legal option.",,,,,,5.5,"The controversy surrounding gay marriage continues to divide societies around the world. Some argue that permitting gay marriage brings negative consequences, such as eroding traditional values and causing tension among families who may not approve of same-sex relationships. On the contrary, others see the recognition of gay marriage as a matter of fundamental human rights and believe that everyone should be free to marry whomever they love. From my perspective, gay marriage should be legal because equal rights form the foundation of a modern and just society. When people are granted the freedom to marry regardless of gender, it promotes greater acceptance and dignity for all citizens. For instance, in countries where gay marriage is legalized, there has been a noticeable shift towards more compassionate attitudes, enriching the overall social fabric. Moreover, denying gay couples the right to marry only perpetuates discrimination and can have damaging psychological effects on individuals who may already feel marginalized. While some opponents suggest that allowing gay marriage might confuse traditional family structures or impact young people, these concerns overlook the fact that legality does not dictate personal choice, but rather ensures fairness under the law. In conclusion, although it is important to respect differing opinions, the legal recognition of gay marriage is an essential step toward equality and social harmony."

Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Some people argue that gay marriage it is a trend that might negatively affect society. Controversially, some others believe that same-sex marriages are natural and people have the right to choose this kind of marriage. This essay discusses why gay marriage should not be defined as a trend but regarded as a people's right, thus as a legal marriage.
During the last few years, several arguments arose against or in favour of same-sex marriage. For decades, people believed that gay people should not be allowed to get married as it was considered against the traditional image of a family. For example, same-sex people wouldn't be able to love and care for a child as a traditional family could. The belief behind this thought is related to the patriarchal educational concept where a child needs to grow in the presence of a mother and a father. Thus, same-sex relations are considered not natural by some people. Considering the definition of love and what caring for someone involves in, isn't indicated that same-sex people cannot feel and express love to each other and care for someone. Love is a feeling that goes beyond the gender. As such, people have the right to love and get married.
,
hence, due to the presence of such a patriarchal belief in most of the world's countries, gay marriage isn't a legal right yet. In a world where people express the need to be more democratic, politically correct and free from biases and discrimination, same-sex marriage should be globally legalised. As such, a change of mindset might be needed. for example, people should begin to see marriage as an expression of love rather than a right and moral action to procreate.
To sum up, while for some people same-sex marriage is only a trend that should could impact the society, for some others, gay marriage it is a natural expression of love. Thus, marriage should be allowed regardless the gender and people's sexual-orientation. govemrnts. should support and legalised same-sex marriage.",,,,,,6.5,"The debate about whether gay marriage should be legalized continues in many countries, with people holding diverse opinions on its effects on society. On one hand, there are those who argue that gay marriage could undermine traditional family values or disrupt social norms, worrying about the influence on children and the structure of the family unit. However, others believe that everyone should have the right to choose their partner, regardless of gender, because love is a fundamental human experience. In fact, there is little evidence to suggest that children raised by same-sex couples suffer disadvantages compared to those raised by opposite-sex parents; for example, research has found that what matters most for a child's wellbeing is the presence of loving and supportive parents. Furthermore, legalizing gay marriage can help reduce discrimination and show that all forms of committed love are valid. In my opinion, gay marriage should be legal, as it promotes equality and respects individual freedom. Denying marriage rights to same-sex couples is a form of discrimination that societies striving for fairness and justice should aim to eliminate. Therefore, by legalizing gay marriage, societies can foster greater acceptance, unity, and respect among their citizens."

Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Thanks to the modern society, people feel free to behave more naturally than before, without the necessity of hiding aspects of their personal life, such as the sexual orientation. For that reason, the number of omosexual women and men seems to increas and some people are worried about the impact that this could have on the society. In my opinion, the government should not interfere with this topic and, consequently, gay marriage should be legally allowed.
Nowadays, being a omosexual couple is difficult because the society does not recognise them the same rights of an eterosexual couple, such as the possibility to adopt children or to share goods. As human beings, gay women and men should have the same opportunities and rights of every other people. Hence, they should be allowed to legally marry and live their life as a normal one.
Furthermore, I think that gay couples do not affect the wellness of the society in any way. Indeed, even if people believe that the only possible family is the traditional one, it is not true and other kind of family does exist. Many children grow up by people of the same sex and this does not affect their education or influence their thought. For that reason, different type of family should be recognised.
Considering the above point, I think that people should have the right to choose from their own who to share their life with, without any legal restriction. In order to allow that, the governement should legalize the marriage between gay couples.",,,,,,6.0,"In recent years, the question of whether gay marriage should be legal has sparked heated debates around the world. While some individuals argue that such unions could have harmful effects on society and threaten traditional values, others feel strongly that everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, should have equal rights when it comes to marriage. Personally, I believe that legalizing gay marriage is a crucial step towards a fairer and more inclusive society. It is fundamentally unjust to deny people the opportunity to marry whom they love simply because of their gender. For example, in countries where gay marriage is legal, studies have shown that acceptance and understanding towards the LGBTQ+ community have increased, fostering diversity and social harmony. Moreover, allowing gay couples to marry provides them with legal benefits and protections, such as inheritance rights and hospital visitation, which are essential for their well-being. While some worry that these changes may negatively influence the structure of families, evidence suggests that children raised in same-sex households are as healthy and happy as those from traditional families. In conclusion, I believe that legalizing gay marriage is not only the right thing to do from a human rights perspective, but it also helps build a more equal and compassionate society for all."

Some people firmly believe that they are bad for society, whereas others preach that people should be free to choose the person they want to be with for the rest of their life, regardless of gender. I endorse freedom of choice and following your heart and for those reasons I support the idea of gay marriages being legal and widly accepeted.
In today's world people are thought to treat everyone equally, to accept other people's desires and opinion and not to judge them based on that. Morals that did not exist in that past. Happiness should not be judged or illegal. When a person is happy he will want to give back and help others by, for example, volunteering and solving public issues and participating in charity organisations.
Furthermore, the acceptance of gay marriages has other great effects. For example, gay people biologially cannot have offspring. This has two main benefits . Firstly, world population is growing at an alarming rate and gay marriages help lower that rate of birth because of their biological nature. Secondly, if a gay couple decides that they want to have a child, they can addopt one. That is great because nowadays orphanages are a shellter for many kids who do not have a family.

Many people argue that legalizing gay marriage could harm traditional values, while others insist that everyone deserves the right to marry whomever they love. I believe that gay marriage should be legal because personal freedom and equal rights are essential in any modern society. One reason is that denying gay couples the right to marry is a form of discrimination and goes against the principle that all people should be treated fairly. When two adults wish to commit to a lifetime together, their gender should not matter, and society should support their choice, just as it does for heterosexual couples. Moreover, legalizing gay marriage sends an important message of inclusivity and acceptance, which can make people feel more valued and less isolated. For example, in countries where gay marriage is legal, studies have shown increased mental wellbeing among LGBTQ+ communities and a decline in negative stereotypes. Additionally, legal gay marriage can benefit families by giving couples the same legal protections and rights, which is especially important when it comes to raising children or making medical decisions for loved ones.

To begin with, nowadays, human equality is becoming more and more important. Hence, men should have the right to marry a person with the same gender. Since this right is one of the fundamental living, governments should revise the law to reflect this type of marriage and enforce it accordingly. This is exemplified by developed countries, which pay attention to human rights, allowing a man to marry another man legally.

Secondly, legalizing gay marriage allows same-sex couples access to important legal protections and benefits, such as inheritance rights and health care decisions, that heterosexual couples already enjoy. Finally, when societies embrace diversity and respect the personal choices of their citizens, this can promote greater harmony and acceptance among all people. In my experience, friends in countries where gay marriage is legalized often feel safer, more respected, and more willing to contribute positively to their communities.

This question remains quite arguable currently. A part of the population tends to have the opinion that gay marriage could affect the community in a destructive way, while the other part sees this perspective as the development of social nature, freedoms, and basic human rights. I believe that every individual person has the own will to decide for themselves who they want to marry, overall, other people are not the ones to make a decision.
First of all, it is widely recognized that conservative and religious societies have a low tolerance for gay marriage because it can destroy their core values and outlook in life. It is generally known that such people think that the legalization of gay marriage can lead to the devaluation of heterosexual couples and their marriage, which is extremely harmful to the community. For example, there is one opinion widely spread in Utah that such legalization can devalue heterosexual marriage, which will lead to an active extramarital sex life, and therefore to a wild increase in the number of abortions. So, it is clear that gay marriage can be adverse.
On the other hand, forbidding marriages that are not heterosexual equals ignoring the basic rights and freedoms of every person. Besides, the research in Utah shows that the previously mentioned fear is completely irrational and Global Health Organization declared that being homosexual is not one of the mental problems. When couples live together and love each other but can not be bounded by official documents, it can cause a lot of legal problems. For instance, when one of them is in the hospital in critical condition, the other can not make a decision about treating or even visiting a beloved one due to the fact that they are not legally related. Such conditions could lead even to fatal consequences.

It also resolves many practical problems, such as hospital visitation rights and inheritance for same-sex couples.

with that sounding strongly controversial, with no middle grounds to meet, I might as well take a side. no. I don't think this sounds logical.
throwing your parental responisbilities on outside factors such as 'government' or 'a universal conspiracy' is merely being paranoid. the government does not benefit from creating obese children, nor do they have the leisure time for such idiotic problems. point such allegations on business companies, it sounds more believable.
whenever obesity is mentioned, my mind jumps into the bigger picture of children given allowances, of which they barely save from and continuously spend on unhealthy food. that, my dear, is the reason for obesity. lack of observation, lack of strict rules, lack of awareness. as a mother, it is important to monitor your children's diet and health. it is equally important to give them a good space to play sports in, which would greatly decrease obesity rate. assuming that the government has a hand in such trivial matters, they won't control you from looking after your children properly. that, as well as a point metioned previously: what do they benefit? spending money and effort and time on, lets say, sponsors to attract children to candy, funding children sweets, and sponsoring for attractive street food to engrave the constant need for those in a child's mind. the question is, what do they gain in return? it is foolish to fund that that doesn't give back equal benefit
so let's state it again, only a foolish government is responsible for the rise of obesity in children",,,,,,5.5,"There are many opinions about why childhood obesity is becoming such an alarming issue, and while some people insist on blaming the government, I would have to disagree. It's too simple to say that government policies are the major cause when, in reality, it is more to do with individual choices and family habits. For one thing, parents have the best opportunity to set healthy routines, such as preparing balanced meals and limiting screen time. I've seen countless cases where children snack on junk food or fast food because their parents allow it, or even encourage it for convenience's sake. The idea that the government is out to make children unhealthy doesn't make sense, as there is little evidence to suggest that authorities directly encourage unhealthy eating or prevent physical activity. Of course, governments could do more to promote public health, like supporting educational campaigns or building parks, but at the end of the day, families must take responsibility for what their children eat and do. It’s not only unrealistic but also unhelpful to blame government for childhood obesity without considering the important role played by parents and communities themselves."

It is argued that the government should be held solely responsable for this pandemic, but I personally disagree with this statement.
The government is already taking measures to prevent this devastating issue. Firstly, it is promoting numerous campaigns against obersity at a young age showing the detrimental effects that this condition can trig in a life time with the terrific consequences. Moreover, authorities are trying to correct unhealthy habits, taxing sugar in drinks and foods and removing sweet and high fat products from public areas, such as schools and hospitals. Therefore, Government can be consider highly active on confining the increased percentage of overweight children.
Not only ministries are exstensively advertising health pattern to control weight and discourage consumption of toxic products, but they are also involving the communities in outdoor events, such as presenting the new city soccer team. So that, while promoting sports and active lifestyle, youngster can be influenced by these athletes to pursue a better physical conditions. Nevertheless, government is promptly enhancing the importance of personal training class in primary school offering schoolars the possibility of choosing gym as extra class to add to their curriculum.
To conclude, although obesity rates are rapidly raising, I do not agree that government is responsible of this outcome. Clearly, it is broadly active engaging children in outdoor activities, yet limiting products from public areas.

Some argue that government is responsible for the rise in childhood obesity, but I do not fully agree with this viewpoint. While it is true that authorities could play a greater role in regulating food quality and promoting healthy lifestyles, I believe that parents, schools, and even the children themselves hold significant responsibility. For example, many families continue to rely on fast food because it is convenient and affordable, despite government efforts to educate the public about nutrition. Furthermore, schools are already offering more physical education and healthier lunch options, sometimes going beyond what the law requires. Personally, I have seen classmates choose junk food from nearby stores after school, even though such items are not available within the school premises, demonstrating that individual choices and family habits outweigh government influence. In conclusion, while the government should continue supporting healthy initiatives, it cannot be solely blamed for the rise in childhood obesity, as personal and parental responsibility are equally important factors."

Parents and government share the responsibility to keep children well-being. This essay will discuss reasons and examples of how both sides have responsibilities toward the children.
To begin with, Politicians should have an obligation to legislate laws that stop some food companies from selling high-calorie diets in the country. Laws toward diet companies should ban them from increasing sweeteners in candies to rise profits. In the same manner, the government has a duty to build outdoor play-ground and clubs to help parents raise healthy kids. Gardens should be grown to overcome obesity. In the UAE each block in the city has its own garden and playground. Research in the Netherlands shows a huge decline in obese children after the government renewed old playgrounds.
Parents on the other hand share a tremendously important rule. Parents should encourage their children to practice sports and substitute bad habits. Pampering the kids with a sweetened diet should be stopped. Parents should read about the effect of obesity on their kids' health. For example, simple sugar rise the glucose level rapidly causing the unexpected energetic status of the kid before bedtime. Some medical cases were seen among children related to obesity like cardio-pulmonary illnesses. If the parents were aware of these consequences they would discourage the bad habits of their children.
To sum up, government do its role in keeping the kids' wellness by building institutions and providing laws on their behalf. Also, parents should educate themselves and their children, and stop unnecessary food habits.",,,,,,6.5,"The problem of childhood obesity is becoming more serious each year, and many people point fingers at the government for this growing concern. While I agree that government does have some responsibility in this matter, I believe that the issue is more complicated and that families, schools, and society in general also play significant roles. Governments can influence public health by passing regulations to limit the advertising of unhealthy foods to children or by requiring food manufacturers to provide clearer nutrition labels. For instance, some countries have put taxes on sugary drinks and fast food, which has helped decrease consumption among young people. Additionally, the government can encourage kids to be more active by developing parks and funding sports programs at school. However, parents and guardians are ultimately the ones responsible for what their children eat at home and for encouraging healthy habits from a young age. In my experience, kids whose families ate home-cooked meals and played outside together were healthier than those who relied on fast food and screen time. Thus, while the government should take measures to support healthy lifestyles, it takes the combined efforts of everyone to truly reduce the rates of childhood obesity."

I strongly disagree with this opinion. I think that state policy cannot lead to the people's obesity. Moreover, I am sure that only parents are responsible for their children diseases.
First of all, it is important to say that government's actions can not be followed with the obesity. It is responsible only for control that all available products are not dangerous for people's health. Food that consist of a lot of fats do not put your health under the threat after the first consumption. Only overeating of this kind of food can be harmful for your health leading obesity. For instance, there is no government's responsibility if you go to the mall and buy 6 cans of beer providing health problem for yourself. I am sure that government is responsible only for making 1 can of beer acceptable for your health.
Secondly, children's actions and potential consequences of these actions should be controlled by their parents. Obesity can be a result of a permanent overeating. Because of their age, chilldren cannot control themselves. That is why this responsibility goes on their parents. As it was mentioned before, there is no product that can be harmful for the healh after the first and the only consumption. There is no reason to condemn government because of the permanent consumption of any products. For example, child could eat 3 pieces of cake insted of 1 just because of his wish. In this case, his parents should stop him after the first one to avoid potential obesity.
In conclusion, I would like to say that I do not see any reasons to say that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children. It has no responsibility for people's overeating and lack of parents' control over their children.",,,,,,7.0,"Many people argue that the government is to blame for the growing problem of childhood obesity, but I do not agree with this viewpoint. In my opinion, the main responsibility lies with families and individuals rather than the government. First of all, parents should be the ones guiding their children's eating habits and making sure they get enough physical activity. For example, if a child eats fast food every day or spends hours watching TV, it is up to the parents to set healthy limits and encourage better choices. The government can try to educate people about the dangers of unhealthy food, but it cannot control what every family eats or how much exercise they get. Secondly, children themselves, as they grow older, start making their own decisions, so teaching them about nutrition from an early age is something for parents and schools, not just government campaigns. Although the government does have some influence, such as setting food safety rules or banning certain advertisements, these efforts cannot solve the problem without personal responsibility. In summary, while the government may play a small part, it is ultimately up to parents and children to make healthy choices and prevent obesity."

Do you think it is a positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The next essay will talk about the reasons behind the need of some people to find out about their own family history.
I believe in certain young countries as USA for example, it is completely logical to feel the need of getting to know where your roots come from.
We have to take into account that in many cases a sector of the USA population only know the nationality or the history of their grandparents, and their grandparents have very few information of their own parents, so the total history of their family is quite sort. I am spanish and lived for one year in the state of Washington with an american family. It was very surprising for me to find out how proud that family was of its european roots. It took me a while to understand their feelings. I needed to put myself into their shoes. To give a live example, my american Dad had even visited the northern part of Norway, close to the Artic Polar Circle to look for a distant cousin he had figured out he had. My american Dad was the happiest person on earth when showing the picture of his cousin and him taking a beer in Norway.
I believe there are many reasons for someone to dig into history to have a deeper knowledge of his own family. Firstly you may get a better understanding of the behaviours of your closest relatives. Also you can find the reasons behind the colour of your skin or your eyes.
To summarise, I strongly believe it is positive to get to know more about your own roots and about your distant relatives to get a better understanding of youself.",,,,,,6.0,"In recent years, many people around the world have become increasingly interested in discovering their own family history. There are several reasons for this curiosity. Some individuals want to learn more about their heritage to better understand their identity and the traditions that may have been handed down through generations. Others are interested in finding connections to historical events or famous ancestors, which can lend a sense of pride or belonging. Additionally, modern technology has made it easier than ever to research genealogy, with online databases and DNA tests providing faster access to information that was once difficult to obtain. I think this trend is largely positive, as knowing one's family background can help people feel more connected to their roots and cultivate a sense of continuity in their lives. For example, after my aunt began researching our family tree, she discovered that our ancestors had immigrated from Italy to South America, which explained some of the cultural habits our family follows today. This new knowledge not only strengthened our family bonds, but also deepened our appreciation for our cultural diversity. Overall, I believe that exploring family history is a valuable way for people to learn about themselves and maintain important connections with their past."

There are a lot of web-services which will help to create your own genealogical tree. Some people even hire a special agent, who help them to invistegate some information from various source of infromation.
But why do people do this? In my opinion, there are two main arguments. First of all, some country offer a citizenship for people with specific roots. For example, if you have Jewish roots, you can recieve Israel citizenship. For repatriation you need to have just a quater Jewish roots, it means, that your grandmother or grandfather must be Jewish. Sometimes it could be really difficult to provide it, but genealogical tree is a good support. Second reason why do people explore their history is just curiosity. It is really intresting to understand who were your ancestors. Maybe they were just labor or fermers, but maybe they were very famous people.
In my opinion, this is positive, that people are intresting in their history. As I see, when people are interested in their own history, they become more involved in history of their country or even in world history. In general, history is very important subject, because it could give general overview on how our society works. Also, creating family tree is good oportunity to establish relationship with distint relatives and spend excellent time with your familly.

This growing interest could be because they want to know where they come from or to find a sense of identity and belonging. For example, some people might want to learn about their ancestors’ traditions or understand why certain values are passed down in their families. Also, knowing about family medical history can sometimes help people prevent future health problems. In my point of view, this is mostly a positive trend. Learning about family roots can make people feel more connected to each other. For example, when people talk with grandparents to learn stories about the past, it often brings the family closer. In addition, researching family history can teach people patience and research skills by looking at old documents or photographs. However, I also think there could be negative sides, like discovering something sad or embarrassing about the family, but in general, I believe the benefits are greater. In conclusion, people look for their family history to understand themselves and their past better, and I believe it mostly has good effects for both individuals and families."

People give different motivations as to why they do it. I suppport this activity for reasons I will further explain in this essay.
To begin with, some people want to get information about their family's history just of pure interest. It can be a great hobby for someone to invest their time and enegry into. It will help one destress and have some fun, while also enrichening his area of knowledege. In addition to having something entertaining do to in their free time, one will learn a lot about what his family has been thorugh long before he was born. This is really important because without our anscestors we would not have been born or in other words - without the past there would be no future. If one respects his family and himself enough, he should learn about who they were and where they came from.
Furthermore, learning about one's family history can be very benefitial in finding your talents. For instance, if someone finds out that in the family there once was someone who was great footballer, then this is something one should try out. Geneticaly, some people are born with specific talents, predisposing them to pursuit a ceratin career path. Being aware of your family's past can be a great hint towards your strenghts and weaknesses.

There are several reasons why people want to learn about their ancestors. One main reason is curiosity, as many people want to know where they come from and what their relatives did in the past. This can help people feel more connected to their roots and develop a better understanding of themselves. Another important motivation is health. Sometimes, knowing your family's background can give you important information about diseases or health issues that run in the family, which could help you take better care of yourself. Personally, I think trying to discover your family history is quite positive. Not only does it bring families closer together by sharing stories, but it also helps preserve traditions and culture for future generations. For example, I know someone who found out about an old family recipe while researching his history, and now his whole family enjoys cooking it together. In conclusion, finding out about one's family background is a good thing because it brings many personal and cultural benefits."

Therefore, some people across the world try to research their own family's history in order to appreciate their efforts, this may be out of curiosity. This essay argues that one should not put out their inquisitiveness and should try to learn more about how their family really came to be.
Inquiring about one's predecessors should be persured as learning more about your own family can never be harmful, infact, doing so will only make one more appreciative towards their family and its history. Like, if it is revealed that one's family had made many sacrifices in order to preserve their bloodline and nuture it to what it is today then it would make the current family members thankful for what they have and where they stand.
Having knowledge about one's own family tree is one of the ways to make a person humble and appreciative for what they have, it also teaches a person to work hard for their own family in the future in order to provide them with a good and healthy life. Nowadays, majority of the families have cultures and customs exclusive to their own family and by studying their ancestors, the true significance of these activities can be discorvered, taught and passed down to the future generations.
To summarize, this essay believes that there really are no negatives in learning about one's own family tree, in fact, there are many positives in doing so. Asking parents to talk about their own families is a good way to build healty relationships and the knowlege gained can be passed down to future generations and the familty ehnicity can be preserved and cherished for many more decades.",,,,,,6.5,"In many countries, people are becoming increasingly interested in discovering their family history.

Personally, I believe that researching one’s family background is a highly positive activity. One important reason is that it helps us to value our heritage and learn the important lessons passed down through generations. For instance, I once read about a friend who uncovered the story of his grandparents moving to a new country with very little, and this knowledge made him more grateful for the opportunities he now enjoys. Additionally, uncovering family traditions and stories can bring families closer together, as these shared histories provide a source of pride and unity. While some might argue that learning unpleasant facts about one’s ancestors could be upsetting, I think that knowing both the good and the bad helps us understand ourselves better and avoid repeating the same mistakes.

Probably the most crucial motive people search for their family`s past is to find out about any chronical diseases. One of society`s biggest concern nowadays is healthy leaving. Therefore, by knowing the family health history and genetic predisposition to a specific disease such as cancer or diabetes, one can prepare and take the appropriate mesures to prevent it or have an early treatment.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","The topic of motivation for work has merely failed to be discussed. Someone elaborate that the most significant factor is money while others suppose it is not. As far as I am concerned, although money is of great importance, it cannot always be the most valuable one.
Undoubtedly, money can be a crucial factor to diminish the financial burden of families, especially for those who were born in a poverty-stricken area. To be more specific, only by earning sufficient money can they raise their later generations and keep the elderly. Provided that they cannot find a decent job that allow them to own some disposable money, it would add insult to injury.
However, there are a great number of factors that may be considered as worthwhile to be the motivation of stay in the staff by some people. First of all, being in the workforce can help to strengthen an individual’s interpersonal skills. It is widely acknowledged that there are a colossal number of activities as well as team programmes that require people to collaborate, compromise and compete with the others. Thus, individuals will tend to learn some social skills and become gregarious and sociable, which can help them better adapt themselves to the mainstream society. In addition, people may also get a chance to broaden their horizons and lay a firm basis for future development by staying in the workforce. For instance, under the circumstance that numerous companies may provide the staff with the opportunity to go abroad and get involved in some international programs, people are able to get access to different cultures. As a result, people can develop panning-for-gold thinking rather than sponge-feeding thinking in the process of understanding divergent cultures, which can be beneficial for their future careers.
In conclusion, although money is valuable for individuals to be in the workforce, there are many other factors that cannot be overlooked. Only by treating all the factors rationally can we enjoy the pleasure rather than pressure.",,,,,,7.0,"Whether money is the primary motivator for staying in the workforce remains a topic of considerable debate. While I firmly recognize that financial stability is a fundamental necessity for most people, I do not fully agree that it is always the most significant reason individuals continue working. Money undeniably enables people to provide for their families, secure comfortable living conditions, and plan for the future, which is especially crucial for those facing economic challenges. Nevertheless, there are other notable factors that attract people to the workforce. Personal ambition, for example, drives many to pursue greater career achievements, seek recognition, and find fulfillment through their accomplishments. Additionally, social connections at the workplace can foster a sense of community and belonging that is difficult to replicate elsewhere. Some people also find immense value in the personal growth that comes from overcoming professional challenges or learning new skills. For instance, I have a close friend who, despite having sufficient savings, remains in her job because it allows her to collaborate with inspiring colleagues and contribute to meaningful projects. Therefore, while money plays a vital role, I believe it often interacts with other factors, and its importance may vary depending on individual circumstances and values."

It is true that nowadays almost everything is somehow connected to money, but I still believe there are some exceptions.
The reason why I agree with this statement is because society today is built up on finance resources. People somehow believe that if you do not have expensive things or an amazing car you are below them. Since money is the merit of a popularity and a good life, many people are remaining in the same job if they are going to be promoted or they are going to receive a pay raise soon, even though coworkers are poisonous and bad for their mental health. For example, it is easier to stay in their position with good money and bad colleagues than to change their job and try to make their way up again.
On the other hand, a lot of youngsters will probably choose the good working environment and nice group of people with who they will be working with, before a long payroll. Of course, it is pleasant to receive a huge amount of money every month but, if you will be working with people who are rude and annoying, you will be out of energy soon and moreover your workforce will be lower as same as your payment in the end.

Financial security is undoubtedly essential, as it allows people to support their families, pay bills, and save for the future; people are less likely to leave a well-paid job, even if it is not their dream role. However, many employees also value job satisfaction, a supportive work environment, and opportunities for career growth. For example, I know some people who have refused higher-paying offers in order to stay at companies where they feel respected and can pursue their personal interests. In situations where employees face toxic workplaces, even a high salary cannot entirely compensate for the lack of well-being or a sense of purpose. In conclusion, while I agree that financial rewards are a strong motivator, they are not the sole factor, and aspects such as positive relationships and professional development also have a significant impact on why people remain in the workforce."

Some people say that this is due to money, however, I strongly oppose that money has the hugest impact on this choice in modern society. I feel this way for 2 reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.
To begin with, working is considered one of the crucial factors to fulfill people's life. Specifically, most people would be satisfied when they are helpful to others through their work. Besides, these experiences would easily contribute them to further hard work. Above all, human beings originally like being appreciated by someone. To be more specific, I like my job because I can feel self-confident through my work. It is manifest that money is not only the vital motivation for working in this regard.
Some augments can be made that social status gained through the success of their business must be crucial enough to direct people to work. The main reason for this is that experiences of success would bring excitement and happiness to them. They also could feel superior to others. Close examination would reveal that people with high social status could have tons of options compared with common people. That is to say, it is completely evident that higher social status can become an important factor as money.
Having considered all the augments above, I would conclude that only money has the most influence on motivation for business.

For example, I have a friend who works as a teacher; although her salary is not very high, she finds joy in inspiring young minds and feels a sense of accomplishment when her students succeed. Furthermore, the workplace can provide important opportunities for social interaction and personal growth. Many people look forward to collaborating with colleagues and forming friendships, which can be just as rewarding as monetary gain. In addition, some individuals are motivated by the opportunity to achieve recognition or a higher status within their field.

Partly, I agree that money is the most important factor which makes people stay in their job.
The reason is because we work in order to be able to purchase our daily needs. It's undeniably true that we need money to sustain our daily life. We have to use our money to pay our bills such as foods, electricity, debt and other basic needs. Furthermore, we know that the number of the number of inflation keeps increasing this year due to the unstabilty of the economic circumstance which results in the increament of goods prices. Having said that, money becomes very essential reason to stay in the company because it really helps us to afford a better life.
However, in my opinion, there is another important aspect that we should consider when we are in middle of deciding whether to stay in the company or not. The important aspect is the working environment. Aside from money, we have to make sure that we can improve our skills in the current employment. By having a positive and supportive working environment, we will be able to maximize all of our capabilities which can make us a better person professionally.
In conclusion, I agree that money becomes one of the most important factor that we should consider in choosing our job as we need money to afford a good life.

Certainly, earning an income allows people to meet their basic needs such as food, housing, and healthcare, and in most societies, having a stable job is seen as necessary for supporting oneself and one’s family. This is especially true as the cost of living continues to increase, making financial security a primary concern for many workers. Nevertheless, I believe that money is not the only important motivation. Many people also place great value on working in a positive environment where they feel respected and can build good relationships with colleagues. Opportunities for learning new skills and advancing in one’s career can be equally motivating, as people often want their work to be meaningful and fulfilling. For example, some of my friends have chosen to stay at their jobs even when offered higher pay elsewhere, simply because they enjoy the culture and find the work interesting.

243,2,Write about the following topic.Some people feel that manufacturers and supermarkets have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging of goods. Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The public is rarely found agreeing on one opinion. One might take a simpe problem such as manufacturers responsible for excessive packaging, or customers should avoid buying such goods as example. Let me tackle this problem in brief.
Manufacturers and supermarkets may be noticed selling their goods excessivly packaged, and that may dissatisfy a portion of their customers. Those customers believe that such sellers should reduce such packaging. Looking into it, it sounds that sellers would also be responsible if their goods where damaged, which would lead to a decrease in income. It also does cost a little more to wrap goods securely to avoid damage, so while that may be a little inconvenient for manufacturers, it is necessary to avoid serious losses later on.
Customers have full right to avoid excessivly packaged goods, if it so contrasts their taste. They may feel it is tiresome to unwrap, or hard to get rid of all the mess it creates afterwords. They would think that is a manufacturer's task to unwrap the goods once they are available at the market, or even once the arrive at their houses if it is an online service. It would logically seem much convenient to them to have instant access to their product instead of all the unpackaging that preceeds the unboxing purchased goods.
Personally, I believe a little unwrapping isn't so invonvenient, and it doesn't have to fall on a manufacturer to unwrap his goods before selling. A little unpackaging might even be thrilling sometimes, to build up excitement before unboxing your awaited product. I'd add, with little offense meant, that people are getting a little lazy to do a simple task as unpackaging.",,,,,,7.0,"There is often a debate about who should take responsibility for the large amount of packaging found on goods these days; some feel it is up to manufacturers and supermarkets to take steps to minimize packaging, while others suggest it is the customer's role to stop buying items that are over-packaged. First of all, companies and stores are significant contributors to the issue, since they often pack their products excessively, claiming it is to preserve freshness or protect against damage. If they changed their policies and adopted environmentally friendly packaging, it would certainly make a difference on a large scale. However, one cannot ignore that the competition between brands often leads them to use shiny and elaborate packaging to attract customers. On the other hand, consumers are the ones ultimately purchasing these goods, and if they made a conscious choice to buy products with less packaging, manufacturers would soon take notice and adapt their offerings. People might feel that it is difficult to find alternatives, but if more people started demanding better options, stores would be forced to listen. For example, when customers began to prefer reusable bags at supermarkets, shops started offering them more widely. In my opinion, both sides share the responsibility, but customers should use their buying power to influence manufacturers toward better packaging practices, as real change is only possible when both sides are involved."

Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The use of products and goods with a lot of packaging is a highly controversial topic between people today. A lot of people believe it is the manufacturers and supermarkets responsibility to reduce packaging of goods, while others believe that it is the individuals responsibility to avoid buying products with a lot of wrapping and packaging. I personally believe that it is the individuals responsibility to cease buying products with an increased amount of packaging, since a decrease in demand from customers could prevent further production of these goods.
The people that is of the opinion that it is the manufacturers and supermarkets responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging, believe that these companies have a moral obligation to preserve and protect the environment. In my country it is believed that these companies should be held responsible by the government. For example in Denmark the government provides manufacturers and stores with certain environmental regulations, which also include the amount of material these facilities are allowed to use for packaging. This helps reduce environmental harm and provides more responsibility to companies to reduce packaging.
However, the majority of people believe that this problem is an individual responsibility. This opinion considers that the moral obligation falls on the individual and not the company. The people who believe that it is an individual responsibility to not buy these products, believe that a decreased demand for products that harms the environment will lead to more environmentally friendly products produced.
To summarize, both of these opinions help reduce environmental harm. However, I believe that it is the individuals responisibility to not purchase overly packaged products, since this decrease in demand would lead to less production of these goods.",,,,,,7.5,"There has been much discussion about whether the responsibility for reducing the amount of packaging on products should fall on manufacturers and supermarkets, or if it should be up to individual customers to make better choices. Some people argue that manufacturers and stores have the power to make the biggest difference by reducing packaging, as they control how goods are presented and shipped. For instance, many large companies can afford to switch to more sustainable packaging, and they can set an example for the industry. In my city, some supermarkets have started using paper or biodegradable bags, and this has greatly reduced plastic waste. On the other hand, some people think that individuals must take action by choosing not to buy goods with excessive packaging. The idea is that if customers stop buying those products, companies will be forced to change their practices in order to maintain sales. This was seen in my own experience when local shoppers began avoiding certain brands that used too much plastic, leading those brands to change their packaging. In conclusion, while both sides play an important role in reducing packaging waste, I believe the main responsibility belongs to the producers and sellers, as they have the resources to make larger changes, but individual choices also help to encourage these changes over time."

In order to reduce the amount of packaging, some people believe that manufacturers and supermarkets are more responsible for taking measures, while others insist that customers play a more critical role in reality. In my view, the effort needs to be made by the supplier and the consumer both to guarantee the achievement of the goal.
On the one hand, the problem of over-packaging is often caused by commercial strategy. The supplier attempts to use beautiful packaging to make their products more attractive to customers. It is fairly easy to imagine that people would be more likely to choose a product decorated gorgeously than the same one with a plain appearance provided that there is thus no significant increase in price. Following that, producers would try to make every effort to obtain more competitive packaging for their products, which probably leads to excessive use of the wrap. Therefore, it is undoubtedly the duty of the producer to partake in reducing the amount of over-packaging by finding another way to improve the competitiveness of their products instead of merely attaching more value to their appearance.
On the other hand, the behaviors of customers give rise to over-packaging as well. The more attention that people will pay to the appearance of goods, the more encouraged producers will be to exert themselves on wrapping. Moreover, the public awareness about the harmful influence of over-packaging is also profound in decreasing the amount of packaging. As customers take the problems caused by over-packaging into account, they would be more willing to purchase the goods with less packaging, which is a highly practical way to prevent producers from wrapping unduly.
In conclusion, it is clear that suppliers and customers both are responsible for the trend of over-packaging. Therefore, the success of altering the situation needs the participation of them both.",,,,,,8.5,"Excessive packaging of goods is increasingly being scrutinized for its impact on the environment, and debate continues over whether manufacturers and supermarkets or consumers should primarily bear responsibility for alleviating this problem. Supporters of holding manufacturers and retailers accountable argue that they have the expertise and resources to implement changes on a large scale, such as by switching to eco-friendly materials and designing efficient packaging. Since they are the originators of the products, any adjustment they make is likely to have a significant and immediate effect. For instance, when a large supermarket chain commits to reducing single-use plastics, it can prevent tons of waste from entering landfills each year. However, others believe that individual consumers play a vital role by choosing products with less packaging and thereby signaling a demand for more sustainable practices. When shoppers consistently avoid heavily packaged goods, it compels companies to rethink their packaging strategies to retain customers. From my perspective, addressing this issue effectively requires the cooperation of both producers and buyers. Producers must lead by innovating sustainable packaging options, but consumers should also be mindful and choose products that are kinder to the environment. Only through shared effort can the challenge of excessive packaging be meaningfully reduced."

On one hand, some people argue that since companies design and produce packaging, and supermarkets choose what to stock, these businesses are in the best position to minimize unnecessary materials and offer more eco-friendly options. For example, companies could opt for simpler designs that use less plastic, and shops could encourage customers by stocking products with minimal packaging. On the other hand, there are those who maintain that customers have the power to influence the market by making wise choices, such as refusing to buy items wrapped in excess plastic and bringing their own reusable bags when shopping. If more people avoid heavily packaged goods, companies would likely respond by changing their practices. From my point of view, although individual decisions matter, manufacturers and supermarkets have a greater impact by making sustainable packaging the standard.

If consumers consistently refuse to buy items with excessive wrapping or bring their own reusable bags, stores and producers would be compelled to innovate and cut back on packaging to retain their business.

Ultimately, a joint effort is needed, but the most significant change will likely occur only when companies make environmentally conscious packaging the new standard."

On the one hand, there is a strong argument that producers should lead the way in minimizing packaging, since they have the greatest control over what materials are chosen and how products are presented to buyers. For example, many electronics companies have shifted to using recyclable cardboard boxes, and some food chains now offer items in compostable containers. If manufacturers implement such changes on a large scale, the total amount of waste can be dramatically lowered before it ever reaches the consumer. On the other hand, some people claim that the responsibility rests with individuals who select which products to purchase. When customers deliberately avoid items with wasteful or unnecessary wrappings, like fruit wrapped in plastic trays, companies may be pressured to change their habits to meet demand. For example, several stores have begun offering discounts to shoppers who bring their own reusable bags, rewarding responsible decisions. Personally, I believe that both sides must play a role: companies should make greener choices at the production level, while customers must shop thoughtfully and support sustainable practices. Thus, it is only through a combined effort that the problem of excessive packaging can be truly overcome."

From my perspective, although asking customers take this action is reasonable, I strongly hold that these service providers should play a more important role in this issue.
On the one hand, the reason why some people think customers should have more duties is that it ia driven by their demand. To be more specific, this is because they choose to buy some things with good packaging. But these goods are usually over packaged. Hence, if they reduce their demands for such products, producers and sellers naturally stop over package them to avoid a reduction in their busidness profits. For example, more and more people are persuaded to simply use a piece of paper to wrap the gift box instead of using a large number decorations.
On the other hand, they think it is driven by merchants as they have more control on it. Specifically, in order to sell goods better, they uauslly regard packaging as a tool to attract purchasers. In addition, if their competitors find it does help the sale of products, it also promote the competition on the packaging, which can further lead to excessive packaging. Take fast food for example, it is obviously that sometimes using just one bag can fit all food, but to gain a greater advantage over the competition, they may use a box or more to wrap them, and then, it creates a vicious cycle of over-packaging.

For instance, when eco-conscious buyers select goods with minimal wrapping, companies are often encouraged to follow suit to keep up with shifting preferences. However, others reason that the primary responsibility falls on manufacturers and supermarkets because they have the most influence over how products are packaged in the first place. They can make significant changes by adopting reusable or biodegradable materials and by intentionally limiting the amount of single-use packaging. One well-known example is when certain grocery chains began offering bulk sections and encouraged customers to bring their own containers, which immediately reduced plastic waste. In my view, while consumers play a part by making thoughtful choices, it is ultimately the producers and retailers who must lead the effort for sustainable packaging, as they set the standards and provide the options that shape consumer behavior."
257,2,Reporting of crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers can have adverse consquences. This kind of information should be restricted from being shown in the media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"In recent years, a variety of crimes and other violent news on television, in newspapers, as well as on the Internet report might have increased to a few decades ago. Although some people might be concerned these reports have adverse consequences, I disagree the news should be reported continuously.
To begin with, some parents might be concerned that these reports might be harmful to their children. Children tend to be susceptible to any information, including enjoyable news, and heavy crime news. Therefore, some parents just hope their children watch some healthy news, such as entertainment, sports, and technological innovation news.
On the other hand, some crimes, including violence, and murder cases should
not diminish the volume of news. Recently, the Japanese media tend to hide the actual violent scene. In addition, reporters, and writers tend to explain the detail in the verbal report, or detail in letters. This news must be helpful for parents to prepare some ideas for their children in order not to be involved in some dangerous crimes. For example, parents recently give a cell phone to children to contact any time. In addition, the parents can observe where the children are 24/7 by taking advantage of GPS.
Finally, Japan is one of the safest countries across the globe. Therefore, Japanese people tend to overrate the Japanese society that crimes, including violence, will never happen to our life. In contrast, looking at some reports of crimes and other kinds of violent news will be a great trigger to educate children in order not to be murdered, and avoid kidnapping by criminals.
In conclusion, it is necessary to report crimes and other kinds of violent news for all people to prepare unpredictable future.",,,,,,5.5,"The portrayal of crimes and other violent news on television and in newspapers has become a significant topic of debate. Some argue that limiting such information in the media could prevent harmful effects, especially for younger viewers. I partly agree that there should be some restrictions, but I believe it is still important to inform society about criminal activity. On the one hand, constant exposure to detailed and graphic reports of violence can lead to fear, anxiety, and even desensitization to real-world suffering, particularly in children. In response, some parents wish to shield their children from these disturbing realities and encourage them to focus on more positive or educational topics. On the other hand, completely restricting crime news could cause the public to remain unaware of dangers in their communities. By knowing about certain incidents or crime patterns, people can take necessary precautions, thus contributing to personal and public safety. Furthermore, responsible and sensitive reporting can help raise awareness about social issues and encourage community action. In summary, while violent news should be presented thoughtfully and with some limitations, I believe that reporting it in the media remains an essential tool for informing and protecting society."

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Nowadays, more and more criminal activities and violent events are showed on television and in newspapers. Some people consider that we should restrict those kinds of information because of the adverse outcomes. However, in my opinion, those events shown in the media should not be restricted for the following reasons.
Firstly, reporting of criminal activities and other violent news can reduce crimes. If those criminal and violent information can be showed to the public, people can clearly understand the whole process and detailed scenes of crimes, provoking them more easily think critically serious consquences. Abusing durgs, for example, people will be afarid of the severe effects on both social and personal areas when they vivily see real outcomes it may bring, thus prevent them from committing criminal acts. Hence, there will be fewer criminal activities or violent events occurring on our society. That is why we should not restrict criminal activities being shown in the media.
In addition, restricting the criminal activities may lead to a high rate of crimes. If people cannot easily obtain those information, they may consider that no one care about it and even take part in some criminal activities without thinking. Because they cannot image detailed impacts on social and personal aspects when they think wether can do it or not. Finally, to a large extent, they may commit cirmes and cause some severe consquences, which may bring nagative effects on society.

Firstly, reporting crimes and violence in the media can raise public awareness and keep citizens informed about what is happening in their communities. By knowing about these threats, people can take steps to protect themselves and exercise greater caution. Furthermore, open coverage of crimes encourages accountability, as it helps shine a spotlight on issues that require government action or societal change. If these stories are hidden from the public, individuals may develop a false sense of security and be unaware of dangers around them. Restricting this information may also create an opportunity for authorities to cover up important incidents, reducing transparency and trust between the public and official organizations. In conclusion, although violent news can sometimes have negative consequences, I believe that the benefits of keeping the public informed and fostering transparency strongly outweigh the drawbacks, so such information should not be banned from the media."

Some people think it is not good to report them on television and in newspapers beacuse it can have adverse outcomes. However, in my opinion, we should not restrict this information because of the following reasons.
At first, showing the violent events can decresae some serious crimes. If the public can directly get the criminal informations, which lead to a whole understanding of the criminal process, provoking them more easily to thinking critically inculding the bad effects on social and personal areas. Take abusing drugs for example, people will afraid to touch drugs if they can vividly see the serious outcomes of abuse, which can effectly prevent them to do some crimnal things. Thus, there wil be less crimes and other kinds of violent events happened in our society.
Secondly, restricting the news of crimes to the public may increase the rate of crimes. Take it into more detaily, If people cannot directly obtain the criminal informations, they maybe cannot analysis the the broad of law, thus easily drop into crimes. When they have to choose whether to do or not, they can not consider more details of the serious outcomes for different kinds of criminal events and they just do it. At last, leading a severe consquences which have adverse impact on both social and personal fields.

Some believe these types of reports can cause negative impacts, such as creating fear in the public or even encouraging more crimes. However, I disagree with the idea that this information should be restricted, for several important reasons. Firstly, honest reporting about crimes can help people become more aware of the dangers around them, so they can take actions to protect themselves. For example, if a neighborhood is informed about recent burglaries, the residents may become more careful and cooperate with police, which could reduce future cases. Secondly, the media has the duty to provide the public with true and full information, which includes unpleasant news like violent crimes. Hiding these truths only causes people to be less prepared and less trusting of the media. While it is true that too much focus on violence can be disturbing, responsible reporting, rather than total censorship, is the better solution. Therefore, I believe that crime and violent news should not be completely hidden from television and newspapers, but reported carefully to help people stay informed and allow society to respond effectively."

In my opinion, It is more beneficial to the public to know what is happening around us so I disagree with the statememt above.
Nowadays, you can access different news outlet through television or using your phone as long as you are connected to the internet. Reading or watching the news are more and more accessible to the public. By merely, clicking the link we are able to read or watch the latest news in our area.
There are a lot of crimes happening in the world, it may have a negative consequence but I think it will outweigh the information that we will learn by reading or watching the news. We will able to know what is happening in our area and how to prevent such crimes.
In our area, according to KOMO news there are a lot of thieves lurking around 12 midnight to 4 am. They are usually walking house to house to check the porch if they can steal something. Some thieves check cars if someone forgot to lock it. This gives them opportunity to steal it.
By watching the news, this will alert the public to be on the look out and prevent the thieves from stealing valuable items from us. We can also find ways to be more safe. We can install cameras with motion censors around our house that will notify us if there are people walking around our property.

For example, if local newspapers report about an increase in break-ins in a certain area, residents can be more alert and take steps to protect their homes, such as installing better locks or neighborhood watch programs. In addition, transparent reporting of crime helps to hold authorities accountable and can motivate law enforcement and policymakers to address underlying problems more effectively. Although some people argue that constant exposure to violent news can be disturbing, I believe it is better for the media to provide accurate and responsible coverage rather than hiding important issues from the public.

Sometimes these news could be violents and it could be an issues for our childs. Some people argues that they should be restricted. In my point of view, it is important to protect child from these horrific images, but also we need to keep informed them about the world if we want to protect them.
First of all, children and young people need to be protect from these violent informations. One mean to accomplish that, is to explain to them these kind of violent images. Because, they are in fairly part of their development and that could be have a huge impact on their mental health. For instance, if your children saw an image of attentat in a high school, as a result, it could be difficult for him to go back at school further. Morover, he could likely developed mental health problem, as a phobia or anxiety about high school.
On the other hand, it is important to keep inform them about the real world and they need to be prepare for theses situations. For example, if an attack arrived at their school, your children will be prepared for. Conversely, if they did not watched news, and an attack reached the school, they will not be able to protect them and the consequence could be terrible. As far, news allow us to predict the world and be able to protect us and our family.
As far, we have seen it is important to keep contact with reality, because nowadays, our world are violent and as a result, some image could be violent.

Personally, I believe that while it is necessary to be cautious about exposing sensitive viewers to such content, a complete restriction of violent news from the media is not the best approach. On one hand, graphic reports about murders, thefts, and other violent acts can create fear and anxiety among viewers, as well as desensitize people or even inspire copycat crimes. Children are particularly affected, since their minds are still developing and they may struggle to understand the context of these events. Nevertheless, reporting the reality of crime is important for keeping the public informed and aware of dangers in their communities. People need accurate information to make safe decisions or participate in important discussions about safety and justice. Instead of total restriction, I think media should use warnings, avoid unnecessary graphic footage, and present crime stories carefully, so as to inform but not traumatize audiences. In conclusion, the responsible reporting of violent news is crucial, and it should be managed with sensitivity rather than being hidden completely from the public."

Overall, it is important to enphasyded that people are geting more and more violant and we can't blame only media as a mainly factor for those behavior.
This kind of questions is almost a phylosical one and we will keeping this doubt for a long time, or even never now if people are becoming more agressive because they are more expousure to this kind of news, or if we are having more report regarding to violence just because people are getting more violent.
I believe that people could feel estimulated to be a criminous person when they have a minimium certain that they won't be punish.
For instance, stolen and other minimius crimes had increase at california region after they anounced that stolen under tham $1000 are consider a crime anymore. So the sensation that people could do anything wrong and that is no penalty for that, estimulates the number for stolen.
In other hand, when we see some hardly rules the number of crime are dipest low, as we can see at Dubai, for instance. As all penalties are really hard and strongly implemented this place is considering highest safe.
I bilieve that restricting any kind of information be showen in the media doesn't solve the problem, and, in fact, bring another new problem related to limited population information.

Firstly, the role of media is to inform the public about important events, including crime, which helps raise awareness and can lead people to take sensible precautions. While it is possible that constant exposure to violent news may desensitize individuals or even spread fear, restricting this information could actually result in a lack of transparency and ignorance about real dangers in society. In many cases, when people are aware of the types and locations of crimes, they are better equipped to protect themselves and support community efforts to prevent similar offenses. Instead of restricting reporting, it would be more beneficial if the media presented such news responsibly, focusing on facts and possible solutions rather than sensationalizing violence. In summary, while I acknowledge the possible adverse consequences, I believe that freedom of information is essential, and the answer lies in responsible journalism rather than censorship."
269,2,Reporting of crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers can have adverse consquences. This kind of information should be restricted from being shown in the media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Reporting violent crimes and other violent issues could represents a adverse consequence sometimes. Overall, it is important to enphasyded that people are geting more and more violant and we can't blame only media as a mainly factor for those behavior.
This kind of questions is almost a phylosical one and we will keeping this doubt for a long time, or even never now if people are becoming more agressive because they are more expousure to this kind of news, or if we are having more report regarding to violence just because people are getting more violent.
I believe that people could feel estimulated to be a criminous person when they have a minimium certain that they won't be punish.
For instance, stolen and other minimius crimes had increase at california region after they anounced that stolen under tham $1000 are consider a crime anymore. So the sensation that people could do anything wrong and that is no penalty for that, estimulates the number for stolen.
In other hand, when we see some hardly rules the number of crime are dipest low, as we can see at Dubai, for instance. As all penalties are really hard and strongly implemented this place is considering highest safe.
I bilieve that restricting any kind of information be showen in the media doesn't solve the problem, and, in fact, bring another new problem related to limited population information. When people know what are happening, type of crimes, etc, they could be prepare to handle with those problems and prevent theirselves.",,,,,,5.0,"The frequent reporting of crimes and violent news on television and in newspapers has sparked debate about its possible negative effects. While exposing audiences to violence may worry some people, I think that restricting such information in the media is not the right solution. On the one hand, it is true that constantly seeing violent acts can create fear and anxiety, especially among children or vulnerable groups. Some believe it might even inspire or normalize bad behavior in society. However, I believe that the media also has a responsibility to keep the public informed about real dangers in society. If we start to limit information strictly, people may become ignorant of the risks around them and unable to make wise decisions or protect themselves effectively. Honest reporting helps raise awareness, encourages public discussion about safety, and can lead to pressure on authorities to act against crime. Therefore, I disagree with the idea of completely restricting this kind of news, but suggest that media outlets should focus on responsible and sensitive reporting, avoiding unnecessary details or sensationalism that may increase fear or encourage imitation."
271,2,Reporting of crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers can have adverse consquences. This kind of information should be restricted from being shown in the media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Nowadays, it is often said that mass media interest in reporting crimes and violence happening in our society may lead to negative effects. Therefore, there is a public debate over the opportunity of excluding this kind of news from mass media, such as newspapers or television. In this essay, I will summarize the grounds for my stance, which is completely in favour of this viewpoint.
The mair reason why I believe that crimes and violence news should be restricted is the emulation risk. In this view, television is often watched by kids left alone, who may not be able to fully undestand what they see. Therefore, if they continue to hear about violence and crimes, they may begin to consider them as a normal part of our society and start adopting these behaviours. For instance, a teenager may think that it is normal to fight with someone else in case of an argue outside pubs or clubs.
Another reason in favour of crimes and violence news restriction is the exaltation of criminals. This may be epitomised by serial killers: on one side they are sentenced for terrible crimes, but on the other hand are sometimes proposed to accept a huge amount of money in order to make interviews or write books about their stories. If media did not talk about these crimimals, none of them would earn money as a consequence of its guilts.
In conclusion, I believe that there are many valid reasons for claiming a reduction of violence and crimes news on social media. Emulation of wrong behaviours by young people and enrichment of criminals are two of the most common arguments. All thing considered, I strongly advocate the need of restricting mass media's time spent to talk about crimes and violence. This aim may be pursued by public authorities, through the promulgation of new laws and rules.",,,,,,7.0,"In today's society, the widespread coverage of crimes and acts of violence by the media has sparked a significant debate regarding whether such information should be limited. Personally, I agree that media coverage of these issues can have harmful consequences, and restrictions may be appropriate. Firstly, constant exposure to violent news can lead to desensitization, especially among children and young adults, making them less sensitive to the suffering of others and more accepting of aggressive behaviors. This risk is particularly concerning when news reports repeatedly broadcast graphic details, potentially giving the impression that violence is commonplace or even acceptable. Furthermore, excessive media focus on criminals sometimes inadvertently glorifies them, providing them with a platform and, at times, encouraging others seeking notoriety to commit similar acts. Such attention can also inflict additional pain upon the victims' families. Nonetheless, I also acknowledge that the media has a duty to inform the public and promote awareness, which are vital components of a transparent society. However, this responsibility should be balanced with care to minimize psychological harm and prevent the spread of fear and imitation. Therefore, while not calling for a total ban, I contend that stricter guidelines should be implemented to limit detailed and sensational reporting, ensuring the media acts responsibly while still fulfilling its obligation to keep society informed."

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Environmental problems are the biggest issue that people have to concern and by product form fossil fuels is one of causes. Someone think one way that can reduce result from fuels is sale car fuels in higher price. In my opinion, I disagree with this because highly price of oil leads to other problems such as financial problem and impact to food price, moreover, we can heal their environment by other ways.
The negative effects of increasing the cost of vehciles fuels are improtant to human life. The significant points is price of basic requirements, for instance, foods and medicines which have to transportation by trucks that use oil fuels for movement. The expensive fuels increase business costs, so their products price are rising up. Futhermore, social problems follow by financial problems. When poor people do not have money but they still hunger, they will steal some food or water this situation roads to social problems.
Other ways to reduce environment problems, the causes of this problem are not only fossil fuel but also agricultural or industial aspect which we have to focus on. Intustial areas are the top areas that make lot of pollutions such as air pollution, water pollution from thier procesing and chemical pollution which they use during process. Those of them lead to many problems and effect to qulity of human life. Moveover agricultural areas, there produce many of gas which result to global warming.

Raising fuel prices might help reduce the number of people using personal vehicles, which could lower emissions for a short time, but it would also create difficulties for those who depend on cars for daily transportation, especially people with lower incomes. In addition, higher fuel prices can mean higher costs for transporting food and goods, leading to more expensive products for everyone. On the other hand, there are more effective and fair ways to address environmental problems, such as investing in renewable energy, improving public transportation, and encouraging the development and use of electric cars. For example, when my city introduced more electric buses and bike lanes, there was a clear improvement in air quality, and people still had affordable options to travel. In conclusion, while increasing fuel prices might help a little, it can create new problems and is not the best way to solve environmental challenges. A combination of policies that promote cleaner alternatives and improved infrastructure would bring better results without negatively impacting people's daily lives."

Although there are some points also neccesaliry developed except for car and other vehicles, I believe spending the cost of fuel for cars which do not emit detrimental substances play the biggest effect for environmental improvement.
Cars, and other vehicles, such as airplanes are ubiquitous around the world. People rely on most transport type must be cars around the world, even in developing countries. In addition, recent cars released in a few decades tend to be durable and the most of energy is petrol which resource is made of fossil fuel. This means that cars emit carbon dioxide across the globe and the highest volume of carbon dioxide is considered by cars. Therefore, the majority of fact about global warming is caused by cars and airplanes.
Recently, the car industry has become aware of this issue and they are starting manufacturing cars that never emit carbon dioxide. For example, some companies, especially Tesla, and Porsche had already released cars that consume energy as electricity, instead of petrol. This effort will cause a drastic reduction of transmitting carbon dioxide and some countries are planning to regulate laws all cars have to consume energy only by electricity.
Finally, of course, there are other issues that lead to harmful environments around the world, such as deforestation, disposal of rubbish by incineration, and agriculture. For example, growing cows too much will generate methane gas which also relates to global warming. However, there is no doubt the total volume of the environmental problem must be cars; and other vehicles. Hence, it is the most effective to shift energy resources from detrimental and limited to sustainable and clean energy in the car industry must be a valuable first step to resolve environmental problems.",,,,,,5.0,"Some individuals argue that raising the price of fuel for cars and other vehicles is an effective solution for tackling environmental problems. While I understand that making fuel more expensive could encourage people to use their vehicles less frequently or turn to public transportation, I do not believe this is the best approach overall. Many people rely on cars for their daily lives, especially in places where alternative transportation is limited, so increasing the cost of fuel could create hardship for ordinary families without significantly reducing pollution. Instead, I believe governments should focus more on promoting the use of electric vehicles and improving public transport systems. For example, in my city, providing subsidies for electric cars and building more reliable bus routes has helped decrease pollution without causing financial stress to residents. Furthermore, stricter emissions standards for manufacturers could also push car companies to develop cleaner technologies. Although rising fuel costs might have some benefits for the environment, I think that combining incentives for cleaner energy with better transportation alternatives is a more balanced and effective way to address environmental challenges."

In my experience, many families rely on their cars for essential tasks like getting to work or school, and simply making fuel pricier does not provide them with other options. Furthermore, without the government investing in reliable public transportation or affordable green technology, people have limited choices. As seen in some countries, higher fuel prices can even lead to public resentment rather than environmental improvements. Therefore, I believe that while increasing fuel costs might discourage some unnecessary car use, alone it is not enough to solve environmental problems; more sustainable infrastructure and accessible alternatives are essential to create real change."

Many urban and rural communities lack adequate public transportation, so people have little choice but to keep using their personal vehicles even if fuel costs rise. For example, in my own city, buses run infrequently and do not reach all neighborhoods, making it difficult for residents to give up driving. Furthermore, increasing fuel prices may unfairly impact those with lower incomes, as they often rely on older, less efficient vehicles and have fewer transportation alternatives. Instead of focusing solely on raising fuel costs, governments might achieve better results by investing in efficient and affordable public transit, promoting carpooling, and encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles through subsidies and infrastructure development. While changing fuel prices can play a part, relying on this single measure is unlikely to bring about significant environmental improvement without accompanying policies that address people’s broader transportation needs."

generally, increasing the cost of gas or fuel would decrease the amount of people utilising environment detriment vehicles. Therefore, the air quality will be healthier for both animals and humans.
In my point of view, this decision will lead to several advantages such as increasing the number of people walking and considering bikes as a way to get anywhere they need. Therefore, goverments will change the current cities structure which are fundamentally depending on cars and vehicles. To transform it to a complete new walkable and more practical cities instead. So that kind of actions has benefits not only for the coming few years but also the future as a whole.
To strengthen my opinion, when gas prices are higher than the average the majority of people will consider another transportation methods that are less damaging and more environment friendly, namely metros, modern trains, bikes or even walking around. However, people also must be educated about curtain aspects when it comes to nature and how to not experience a harmful lifestyle in general, for both the nature and the human race.
to summarize, increasing the gas prices without spreading awarness among youngsters equivalently would not be a convenient action.

When fuel costs rise, individuals are often motivated to drive less or seek alternatives like public transportation, cycling, or walking, all of which have a much smaller impact on the environment. This can help to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, ultimately leading to better air quality and healthier cities. For example, in some countries where fuel is expensive, more people use buses or trains daily, and cities tend to invest in better public transportation systems. On the other hand, simply increasing fuel prices by itself can be unfair to people who rely on their cars for work or do not have access to good public transit, such as those in rural areas. Therefore, I believe it is important for governments to combine higher fuel costs with investments in alternative transportation options and to educate the public about the benefits of sustainable living.

No matter if one's favourite is classical, pop, rock, or rap, it can help people distract their attention from unwanted thoughts, alleviate stress, or even reduce pain. My strong belief is that music has a significant psychological effect in maintaining mental health, and some of its most vital impacts are visible on mood and stress.
Music can induce extremely strong changes in people's mental states. There are several everyday examples that highlight the tranquillizing effect of music. Many people find out merely by instinct that they tend to calm down by listening to their favourite tunes. When someone feels anxious before an important exam, a medical visit, or a long-awaited date, music can provide a couple of minutes escape from these stressful situations, on our way to the event's venue. Soft music is also frequently utilized during meditative activities, such as yoga or relaxation. Additionally, people can come across the same type of calming tunes in dental or medical settings as well. However, these are quite passive coping techniques.
On the other hand, there are more active possible mechanisms by which music can reduce stress. When dancing or working out to upbeat music, people decrease their stress levels through movement. It can be an even more efficient way to let the harmful energies behind because of a two-way effect: music tends the soul, while the movement is good for the body, reducing tension in the muscles.

Similarly, in public spaces such as cafes or waiting rooms, music is regularly played to create a calm atmosphere and reduce anxiety among visitors. Besides listening passively, engaging with music actively through singing or playing an instrument can also be therapeutic, offering a creative outlet to express emotions and let go of daily worries.

people who live in previous centuries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
In this modern age, some believe that people’s quality of life is much better than that of earlier generations in past centuries. I agree with this point of view thanks to the development of healthcare service and technology in this century regardless of some opposing opinions.
To begin with, some think of this school of thought in the sense that people living in the previous centuries were less prone to diseases caused by the degradation of the environment. For example, air pollution these days has caused people a multitude of fatal respiratory diseases, be it tuberculosis or even lung cancer. These illnesses were believed to happen to a handful of citizens in the past, such as long-term smokers or workers in mines. However, in this modern age, people appear to have remedies for aforementioned diseases or, at least, methods to mitigate them. As regards the former, scientists have been believed to invent medicines to cure these diseases while, for the latter, air purifiers have filtered toxic fumes in the atmosphere, reducing the risk of suffering from respiratory diseases.
The standard of living in the 21st century is in all probability better than our predecessors thanks to technological transmogrification. Firstly, the improvements of the Internet has allowed people to connect with others from all over the world via communication platforms, such as social networking sites or emails. This will help people be happy. Additionally, the advancement of technology is beneficial for information storage. For example, data is, now, can be limitlessly stored in the Internet with less concern of being damaged. This did not happen in the past, when information was believed to be saved on papers or hard disks, which were prone to damage due to extreme weather patterns.

For instance, many students, including myself, find that background music helps us concentrate while studying and can offer a peaceful escape from daily pressures. However, music can also foster collective identity and inspire action. For example, national anthems or protest songs have motivated people to unite for shared causes, while traditional folk songs can strengthen bonds between generations by keeping cultural heritage alive. Moreover, music is a powerful medium for expressing a wide range of emotions, from joy and triumph to sadness and longing, which allows individuals to better understand and process their feelings.

While I agree that relaxing to music is one of its most immediate benefits, I believe music serves several equally vital functions in modern society. For one thing, music plays a crucial role in shaping cultural identities and bringing people together during celebrations and important events. For example, in my own country, national holidays are marked by special songs that create a sense of unity and pride amongst the community. Furthermore, music is a form of artistic expression, allowing songwriters and performers to communicate feelings and stories that might otherwise remain unspoken. Besides, the music industry provides employment opportunities for millions of individuals, not only performers but also sound engineers, managers, and technical staff. While listening to favorite songs might help a student to relax after exams, it is clear that music's influence goes far beyond just stress relief, impacting society economically, socially, and emotionally. Therefore, I believe that music’s most important function is not limited to reducing stress but also includes fostering community spirit and enabling personal expression."
295,2,Write about the following topic.Many people use written language in a less formal and more relaxed way. Why? Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"People tend to use more informal words in their language to express and communicate with each other rather than following formal words.
There are several reasons for this, and I believe that it has some disadvantages and advantages. The key contributor to informal writing is technological innovation. For instance, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram allow people to send texts to each other anywhere and anytime just by connecting to the internet.
Furthermore, the texting culture of using abbreviated phrases has grown increasingly prevalent. As a result, applying casual language in written form has become more popular, and this substantially affects the written language.
I believe that this trend may carry a certain degree of risk. Firstly, when using written language in an easier going way many times, people can forget how to write a formal letter. In fact, the current generation gets used to texting, so the young are not aware of how to write a formal email to apply for a job. Instead, they write these emails like they are texting with friends.
Secondly, informal writing can adversely affect the academic performance of students. The students tend to utilize abbreviated words or slang in essays and assignments that require a greater level of formality.
One evident benefit to having more informal written communication in our professional lives is that it is less time-consuming. For instance, busy individuals working on the same task can share information instantly through a quick chat, rather than write a long and formal mail chain that requires thoughtful editing and proofreading.
In conclusion, although there are disadvantages to using informal words in written language, there are also attractive advantages. I believe individuals should use informal words when texting with family and friends but when it's an office or business-related work then they should use formal words in written language.",,,,,,7.0,"Nowadays, people often prefer using relaxed and casual language in their written communication, and this is largely due to the growth of digital technology and social media platforms. Applications such as Twitter, Snapchat, and instant messaging services encourage fast and easy exchanges, which makes people more likely to use abbreviations and slang instead of formal language. For example, many people write “u” instead of “you” in text messages to save time. This shift towards informal writing has its pros and cons. The main advantage is that it allows for quicker, more efficient communication, especially when people are in a hurry or need to connect with others informally. It helps build stronger personal connections and reduces the pressure to be perfect in every message. However, the downside is that it can make it harder for people, especially students, to master the formal writing skills needed in education or the workplace. I have noticed that some younger people struggle when asked to write official emails or reports because they are so accustomed to informal texting. In conclusion, while using informal written language offers convenience and can improve relationships, it is important to remember the value of formal writing in certain situations, such as academic or professional contexts."
297,2,Write about the following topic.Many people use written language in a less formal and more relaxed way. Why? Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is noticeable that when we write something we try to use more informal language. Moreover the written text is more redundant, cohesive, calm and patient. From my point of view, it comes because we erase emotions from written text which we spread sometimes without intention via voice. Not only voice influence on it, but during the writing we have a chance to revise and check our text. Moreover this fact has advantages and disadvantages.
On the one hand, there is a huge advantage of this cartain. When we communicate through formal language and when we are more relaxed we have a chance to spread our ideas more thoroughly. For instance, I sometimes observe that for me it is easier to convince someone to help me if I write to him or her.
On the other hand, there is a disadvantage, that when we switch on to the speech from writing other people will be surprised or astonished with the differences. For example, during my work, I communicate via messages more than via calling. Sometimes there are cases when after this switching people notice that I was rude and insult them.
Finally, written language is more relaxed and less formal. This fact has a lot of cons and pros. I think that cons dominate under pros. What is more, it is a nice way to mix this kind of communication for best results. Neither written way nor speaking will increase your chance to be recognizable in the right way if your basic idea is not relevant to consumers of your main idea.",,,,,,5.0,"It is becoming more common that people write in a less formal and more casual style than in the past. One reason for this is the rise of digital communication like texting, emails, and social media, where speed and convenience often matter more than following strict grammar rules. From my own experience, I find that people write quickly and use abbreviations or emojis to save time and make conversations feel more friendly. This relaxed written language does have both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, it helps people connect more easily and removes certain barriers, making communication more accessible for everyone. For example, if I message a friend using informal words, it feels more natural and helps us stay close. However, there are disadvantages because sometimes important information can be misunderstood if the language is too informal. Also, in professional settings, a relaxed tone can look careless or disrespectful. In conclusion, while informal written language is often useful and fits the fast pace of modern life, there are times when being more formal is necessary, especially to avoid confusion and show respect."
299,2,Write about the following topic.Many people use written language in a less formal and more relaxed way. Why? Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays most people tend to write in a more informal way, adopting a relaxed approach. This essay will cover the reasons why this behavior is so common, starting from the necessity of a more quick way to communicate, and then it will attempt to illustrate if it has advantages and disadvantages.
Hence the necessity to interact in a quicker way, due to the business of life at the present time, many people prefer to cure less the formal aspects of their written pieces. This rapidness has been allowed by the spread of emails as the principal mean of written communication. Likewise, the reader itself, having much less time, is prone to take just a rapid look at the emails, not caring much if the way they are written is formal or not.
On the one hand, this can lead to some advantages, such as a more relaxed atmosphere even in workplaces. For example, many workers are relieved to know that their boss is keen on writing informal emails and does not pretend his subordinates to do otherwise. Moreover, it has some positive implications also for strangers, that are often less prepared to write in a formal style.
On the other hand, it is often hard to draw a limit. Some readers can think that the person sending the informal email is just being rude, leading to a misunderstanding. This is particularly true when the generation gap is taken into consideration: generally, elder people may be less willing to receive an informal letter.
In conclusion, the reasons behind a more relaxed style in written language may be found in the faster means of communication. This has undoubtedly advantages, such as the creation of a more peaceful ambient. Albeit, there are also clear disadvantages, for instance, the misinterpretation of the context.",,,,,,7.0,"In recent years, people have increasingly adopted a more casual approach to written communication, which can be attributed to the rising use of digital platforms such as instant messaging and social media. These platforms have encouraged users to prioritize speed and convenience, often at the expense of traditional grammar and formal language. This shift is largely driven by the need to keep up with a fast-paced lifestyle, where waiting for a carefully composed response is impractical. On the positive side, this informality can make communication feel warmer and more inclusive, breaking down barriers between colleagues, friends, and even customers. For instance, a friendly message from a customer service representative might make clients feel more at ease. Nevertheless, this trend also presents drawbacks, as it becomes more difficult to distinguish between different levels of respect and formality, which can occasionally lead to misunderstandings or a lack of professionalism. Older generations, in particular, might interpret relaxed language as a sign of disrespect. To sum up, while an informal writing style simplifies and accelerates communication, it also poses challenges related to tone and respect, suggesting that a balance should be sought depending on the context."

Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Written language has been in human history since many thousand years ago. It was first developed through ancient egyptians and other old civilizations to keep history safe and remembered. It was then reformed for learning, teaching, documenting know-how and building new civilizations. From the Latin to the modern English, an enormous amount of changes and developments have emerged. Such things were derived through the intent of humanbeings to use easier language to deliver its usages. I am of the opinion, that changing language and using it in a more relaxed way could destroy its basis and strong meanings, which it shall deliver in its original form.
Using a less formal language for writing could be associated with multiple different advantages. More people will be able to write using a language easier and faster, if it is in a more relaxed way compared to the formal version of it. So using such easy version of the language, could promotes the amount of written work, which accordingly supports the idea of keeping our culture remembered. For instance, the amount of written stories in English has doubled through the years after making the english a more easier language to apply and write with. Furthermore, such more relaxed language will help many non-fluent speakers learn and use the language faster, which shall increase the amount of people speaking this specific language.
On the other hand, a couple of critical disadvantages could be distinguished applying such strategy in the written language. Maybe the amount of written ressources increased massively in the last couple of hunderd years, but what about the quality and sophistication of such materials? Are these materials concrete, concise and accurate? Are those materials capturing the needed knowledge within the current generation successfully? These questions trigger that easier language to use doesn't neccessarily mean better documents, but rather massive irrelevant amount of expolited work.
To summarive, I tend to be of the opinion, that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages of using a less formal language in writing. The long-term perspective could be significantly critisized, as only short-sighted point of views, shall think, that such methodology of written language helps human civilizations thrive in any way.",,,,,,6.5,"In recent years, many people have started using written language in a more informal and relaxed manner, especially on social media and messaging platforms. This is mostly because people want to communicate quickly and efficiently, without worrying too much about grammar and formal rules whenever they send texts or emails. The rise of smartphones and the internet makes writing short messages, like ""u"" instead of ""you"", more convenient and faster for everyone. This trend has some good effects, such as making communication more accessible and helping people who are not fluent in a language take part in conversations without fear of making mistakes. In my own experience, I have noticed that my friends from different countries find it easier to join group chats because nobody cares about perfect spelling or strict grammar. However, this relaxed writing style also has some disadvantages. One major issue is that it can make people forget how to write formally, which might cause problems when they need to write essays or formal emails. Another concern is that meaning can sometimes get lost or misunderstood when people use too many shortcuts or slang words. Overall, while the informal style of writing makes everyday communication simpler and brings more people together, it could also result in a decline in traditional writing skills and cause confusion in more serious contexts."

What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Food crisis might be considered as one of the most worrying matters among the globe. Despite the fact that poverty ratios are constantely increasing, tonnes of foods were thrown away every year. I believe that uncountable reasons could be behind this awful phenomenon, and many solutions should be taken to reduce the amounts of these wasted foods and to reduce the starvation. I will mention some in this essay.
Starting from the root causes, cooking a feast for a small group of people might be considered part of any country's culture such as many countries in the golf area, or otherwise, the person would look as stingy or even a bad host. Although some people order a huge amount of food just for the purpose of bragging, sometimes it could be due to wrong estimation of the number of guests or the portion that is needed for each individual.
Nevertheless, such matter should have immediate solutions, on both personal and global level. Governments should take all actions needed to increase the awareness of the danger of this problem and its negative consequences, whether through social media platforms or through the national TV, and to find innovative ways to hold their citizens responsible for minimising such cruical issue. Moreover, individuals should always make sure to donate the extra food to any person that is in need.
In conclusion, wasting food has been a significant issue since very long time ago. There are many reasons for this unpleasant habit, whether due to cultural impact or personal attitude; therefore, fast actions must be taken from both individuals and governments.",,,,,,7.0,"Food wastage is a serious concern in many countries today, despite the existence of hunger in various parts of the world. One of the main reasons people waste so much food is the convenience and abundance in modern societies, which often leads to people buying or preparing more food than they need. For example, many restaurants serve large portions, and people at home may buy in bulk because of discounts or promotions, only to throw away what spoils. Additionally, a lack of awareness about food storage and expiration dates can cause people to discard food unnecessarily. To address this problem, it is important for both governments and individuals to take action. Governments could launch public campaigns to educate citizens about food wastage and how to reduce it, such as by planning meals carefully and storing food correctly. Supermarkets and restaurants could also donate excess food to charities or food banks rather than throwing it away. On a personal level, people should try to buy only what they need and share leftovers whenever possible. If everyone makes a conscious effort, we can significantly reduce the amount of food wasted and help those who are in need."

In my perspective, there are reasons to this problem and some measures should be taken into effect to reduce the amount of wasted food.
Franklly speaking, based on my observation, there are several factors that leads to the food-wasting crisis. Firstly, with the aid of modern technology, especially those related to farming industry, we can get much more stable access to all kinds of crops than our predecessors, which means we no longer need to live in a food-saving lifestyle, thus leading to a number of wastes in terms of food. Secondly, due to lack of educations on saving food in school, the youngsters nowadays tend to be unaware of the importance of adequete food. As a result, people are used to order more amount of food than they actually need, constituting more food is wasted everyday. Finally, as the burgeon of economy in most countries, the fashion of showing off to others is curved into the mind of pubilc, resulting a number of extravegent consuming that could cost plenty of food wasted.
Since the problem of food wasting is taking place everywhere around the globe right now, it is urgent for us to take some actions to deal with the problem. In my opinion, as it is impossible to reverse the development of science, we should then focus on educaitions, specifically children's education. For example, several lectures could be given to the elementary school students to highlight the hardships to grown crops for our ancestors, as well as the reason why we should save the food we eat everyday. On top of that, the autorities could organise the student for some visits to the farming field, where they can learn the basic knowledges needed for farming industry and then understand how harsh it is to grow food that is sold on market nowadays. Once the children aware of the importance of saving food, there certainly will be less food thrown away on a day to day basis.
To sum up, both technologies and lack of public education give birth to food wasting. Althogh several methods could be taken to deal with the problem, it is through our joint effort to reduce the food thrown away everday. Actions need to be implemented swiftly.",,,,,,6.5,"Food waste has become a major concern in many societies, and there are several causes that contribute to this growing problem.

In addition, some individuals do not pay enough attention to expiration dates, leading to food being thrown away unnecessarily. Another factor is that restaurants and cafeterias serve portions that are too large for most customers, so much of the meal ends up in the trash. To tackle these issues, it is important to raise awareness about the consequences of wasting food by promoting educational campaigns both in schools and through the media. Governments and local communities could also introduce policies that encourage smaller portion sizes in restaurants and provide incentives for supermarkets to donate unsold food to charities. Personally, I have seen my own family reduce our food waste simply by planning meals carefully, checking what we already have before shopping, and using leftovers creatively. In conclusion, while food waste is a complex problem caused by consumer habits and commercial practices, it can be alleviated through better education and more responsible policies that promote thoughtful consumption."

This essay will discuss the reason that people are wasting food and suggest a viable solution.
The principal reason is that people are unable to finish their dishes as they often take more portions of food than they can, which can cause more food to be wasted. For instance, buffets are the most common place that wastes tons of food, especially in hotels. Hence, as more food you pick, the more reasonable the price of the buffet is.

For instance, buffets are the most commonly wasted tons of food, especially in the hotel. Hence, as more food you pick, the more reasonable the price of the buffet is.
A solution to this worrying problem is to take away the leftovers back home. As food can be kept for a few days in the refrigerator, people can cook it at their house without going out to afford meals. As a result, this can reduce the expenditure on food and transportation. In my experience, my mother would pack the leftover food and bring it back home. As a result, the food still tastes the same at the restaurant. Thus, my family and I will never discuss what to eat for the rest of the day. Had it not been for preventing food waste by bringing it back home, the amount of waste foods would never have been able to reduce.
In conclusion, one of the main problems with the over-wasting of food in many countries is unable to finish the food and this can be solved by taking away the food back home.

A primary cause is that people often buy or prepare more food than they actually need, especially when shopping in bulk or cooking for large gatherings, leading to excess that eventually gets thrown out. Additionally, restaurants and supermarkets tend to discard food that is still edible but no longer looks perfect, because they want to maintain high standards for their customers. For example, fruits and vegetables with minor blemishes or meals not finished by customers in restaurants often end up in the trash. To address this problem, one effective solution would be for both individuals and businesses to plan their purchases more carefully and find creative ways to use leftovers or imperfect foods, such as making soups or donating extra food to charities. In my own experience, my family has started to freeze leftovers and only buy what we can finish in a few days, which helps us throw away much less food. In conclusion, food waste mostly happens due to poor planning and cosmetic standards, but with more mindful consumption and practical measures, the amount of food wasted can be greatly reduced."

What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Living in the 21st Century, it is without doubt that most of us already possess the luxury of having everything we need such as shelter, clothes and most importantly food and water. Despite this, it is sad to say that there are still a handful of the world's population that remain in the depths of poverty. And even so, many countries are found guilty to wasting huge amounts of food. In this essay, I will discuss the reason behind this food wastage and suggest solutions to reduce this effect.
First and foremost, why do people waste food? It is to my belief that people tend to take more food than they can handle, especially at functions like all-you-can-eat buffets alongside weddings which act as a few of the many major contributers of food waste. In general, there is also the lack of awareness on poverty among the public to blame for. Therefore, people cannot practice consideration towards a cause they are unfamilar or unaware of. Other than that, they lack exposure to knowledge on the impact that food waste can bring to the environment and the society.
Now, what actions can we take to reduce amount of food disposed? The government and country's leaders should take the first step in conducting educational campaigns on food wastes and poverty, particularly targeting school children and the public. This can play a significant role in shedding light onto the issues that need to be addressed urgently. People should also be strongly encouraged to take a more sensible amount of food before coming back for seconds to avoid the unecessary wastage as well as the excess weight gain.
To sum up, food wastage is not something to be proud of because of the all the adverse effects brought upon us, humans. Hence, we should quickly make the much needed change to help to turn this situation around and hopefully contribute to creating a better society.",,,,,,7.5,"In today’s modern societies, it is a concerning reality that food wastage has become an everyday occurrence, even while millions of people still face hunger around the world. One main reason why so much food is discarded is because people often buy more than they actually need, especially when shopping at supermarkets where discounts tempt customers to purchase items in bulk. Additionally, social events such as parties and family gatherings frequently lead to over-preparation of meals, as hosts are often worried about not having enough for their guests. Another contributing factor is that some individuals lack awareness of the true value of food and the effort it takes to produce it, leading them to throw away edible items simply because they are slightly past their ‘best before’ dates or do not look perfect. To address this problem, governments and communities should invest in educational campaigns that teach people about the consequences of food waste, both environmentally and socially. Furthermore, supermarkets and restaurants can help by donating surplus food to charities instead of disposing of it. Lastly, individuals can make a difference by planning their meals more carefully and only buying what they need. By taking these steps, we can collectively reduce the amount of food thrown away and move toward a more responsible and compassionate society."

What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays, many countries are confronted with the increasing amount of waste and one of the major contributions is food wasted by people. This issue is mainly driven by an over-ordered food and misunderstanding about the method of food disposal. However, people could cease from creating food waste through the act of both restaurants and governments.
To begin with, it is obvious that countries have wasted because the amount of food that people buy is more than the amount they need. The crucial factor of this behavior is that when people contemplate menus in a restaurant, they tend to order many items in order to satisfy their desire level. Eventually, a lot of food scraps are left when these people finish eating their meals. Another potential cause could be because people do not know how to deal with food scraps. As a result, they might understand that putting wasted food into a garbage is the only solution they could do. This is exemplified by statistics published by Thai waste association which demonstrate that more than a half of waste in Thailand come from household food.
A possible solution for this matter could be for restaurants to fine their customers who leave some food. This policy possibly encourages customers to carefully think of the reasonable amount of food when they order. In addition, from the country’s level governments could also educate their citizens including companies in the food-service industry about how to do with food waste due to the fact that some edible items could be food for animals. For instance, authorities could give an instruction demonstrating that dogs can be fed with remaining food such as rice or bread while remaining vegetables can be food for rabbits.
In conclusion, people waste food since they order food by what they want without considering the amount and most of them misunderstand about the way to dispose of food waste. Nevertheless, this concern can be coped with the penalty by restaurants as well as the guidance from governments regarding feeding animal with food scraps.",,,,,,7.0,"In many parts of the world, food wastage has become a notable problem, especially as people often buy or prepare more food than they are able to consume. One of the reasons why so much food is discarded is that individuals in wealthier societies tend to purchase goods in bulk, enticed by discounts or special offers, without considering their actual needs. As a result, uneaten food quickly reaches its expiration date and is thrown away. Another factor is that people sometimes lack awareness regarding food preservation methods, like properly storing leftovers, or they might be overly cautious about expiration dates, tossing products that are still safe to eat. To address this issue, both educational and policy measures can be effective. For example, governments could launch public campaigns to inform citizens about accurate interpretation of ‘best before’ labels and techniques for minimizing household waste. Additionally, supermarkets and restaurants could partner with charities to donate unsold but edible food to those in need, as has been done in several countries with promising results. By raising awareness and encouraging better food management practices, society can make significant progress in reducing the amount of food that ends up in landfills."
319,2,Write about the following topic.In many countries large amounts of foods are wasted. Why do you think people waste food in this way? What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays, many countries are confronted with the increasing amount of waste and one of the major contributions is food wasted by people. This issue is mainly driven by an over-ordered food and misunderstanding about the method of food disposal. However, people could cease from creating food waste through the act of both restaurants and governments.
To begin with, it is obvious that countries have wasted because the amount of food that people buy is more than the amount they need. The crucial factor of this behavior is that when people contemplate menus in a restaurant, they tend to order many items in order to satisfy their desire level. Eventually, a lot of food scraps are left when these people finish eating their meals. Another potential cause could be because people do not know how to deal with food scraps. As a result, they might understand that putting wasted food into a garbage is the only solution they could do. This is exemplified by statistics published by Thai waste association which demonstrate that more than a half of waste in Thailand come from household food.
A possible solution for this matter could be for restaurants to fine their customers who leave some food. This policy possibly encourages customers to carefully think of the reasonable amount of food when they order. In addition, from the country’s level governments could also educate their citizens including companies in the food-service industry about how to do with food waste due to the fact that some edible items could be food for animals. For instance, authorities could give an instruction demonstrating that dogs can be fed with remaining food such as rice or bread while remaining vegetables can be food for rabbits.
In conclusion, people waste food since they order food by what they want without considering the amount and most of them misunderstand about the way to dispose of food waste. Nevertheless, this concern can be coped with the penalty by restaurants as well as the guidance from governments regarding feeding animal with food scraps.",,,,,,7.0,"In recent times, the problem of wasting food has grown significantly in many parts of the world, and this is mostly due to both consumer habits and a lack of awareness about food management. A primary reason for this issue is that people often purchase or prepare larger quantities of food than necessary, whether shopping at supermarkets or dining out. Many individuals are swayed by discounted bulk offers or seek variety by trying multiple dishes, ultimately throwing away the excess when it cannot be finished or stored. Furthermore, a lack of understanding about proper storage techniques or confusion regarding expiration dates causes many people to discard food prematurely, even when it is still safe to consume. To tackle the challenge of food waste, there are several effective strategies. Restaurants could offer smaller portion sizes or provide incentives for customers who finish their meals, encouraging mindful consumption. Governments can also run educational campaigns to inform citizens about reading expiry dates correctly and suggest creative ideas to use leftovers, such as sharing recipes or promoting community food-sharing platforms. For example, some cities have introduced mobile apps where citizens can share excess food with neighbors rather than throwing it away. In conclusion, while the culture of abundance and limited knowledge about food storage contribute to food waste, this issue can be alleviated by a combination of cooperation between individuals, businesses, and governments, ensuring that less food ends up in landfills."

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Many people have a opinion that a women can be a good leader than a men. In my opinion, I totally agree with this statement and many reasons will be provide in this essay.
For the first reason, Leadership is a skill that up to a people, and it is not specific by sexes. In modern world, there are many company that let their department lead by both women and men, and to measure the result for comparing a difference that can be shown on profits that own by each section. For example, It is can be argue if the traditional company is let women firstly lead the project rather than previous, which done by a men. However if the result show profit, so it can be proof that even it is not a men the out come still worthy.
Moreover, Women emphathy in leadership is still significantly reason, we can see that people can be at ease for give more opinions by the mother nature when it come arguement or under pressure at workplace. To illustrate, The research shown comparison of two research teams. the one that lead by women tend to have more ideas post-it and opened opinions than the men team. Obviously, we must agree that women can give more friendly atmosphere for workplace and idea generation for people in her team.
In conclusion, For all reasons mentioned above we can see that a women can have better leadership than the men. For the skills that individual have or the nature emphathy that embrace the collegue.",,,,,,5.0,"Some people claim that women possess better leadership abilities than men, while others do not agree. In my opinion, I partly agree with this idea because both women and men have strengths that can make them successful leaders, but women have some qualities that suit leadership in many situations. For instance, women are often more empathetic and understanding with their teams, which can create a positive working environment. Empathy and good communication skills help solve problems faster and make people feel valued. In addition, many studies show that companies with women in leading positions often perform well, suggesting that women are capable of making strategic decisions. However, it is also important to note that men are also strong leaders, and being a good leader depends on the person, not only on gender. For example, I have had both male and female bosses in the past, and both were effective for different reasons. In conclusion, while women may have qualities that make them excellent leaders, leadership is not only about gender, and both men and women should have equal opportunities to prove their abilities."
323,2,Write about the following topic.Some people believe women are better leaders than men. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is argued by some individuals that men aren't skilled enough as women in regard to leadership. This essay disagrees with the given statement as leadership skills are not depending on gender but are strongly related to people's personality and work experience.
The role of a leader should not be stereotyped according to gender, for example, women might be considered more powerful than men because they could normally appear more organised and perfectionist. Indeed, several studies concerning leadership and the role of the leader, have demonstrated that some people have innate attitudes of a leader regardless of their gender. Some of those attitudes are related to active listening, emotional intelligence skills and great communication abilities. Thus, if effectively developed and fostered, those skills can support individuals to achieve higher roles in leadership and management.
In the same way, the working experience also plays a crucial role in determining and further developing leadership skills. For example, a large number of women are still renouncing to their career paths in order to care for their families. Indeed, most of the women, apply for part-time roles which do not offer the opportunity to achieve a leadership role despite their abilities. For this reason, is difficult to affirm if women are better than men in leadership.
To conclude, the role of a leader is shaped by innate characteristics and people's personalities regardless of their gender. Moreover, the poor presence of women employed in leadership roles does not create pieces of evidence to support such a point of view.",,,,,,7.5,"Some people argue that women possess greater leadership abilities than men, but in my opinion, leadership cannot be generalized to one gender. Instead, effective leadership depends on a person’s individual traits and the context in which they work. For instance, women are often praised for their empathy and ability to listen, which are certainly important qualities for a leader, but men can demonstrate these qualities just as well. Additionally, essential leadership skills such as decisiveness, resilience, and adaptability are not inherently stronger in one gender over the other, but are shaped by personal experiences, education, and environment. To illustrate, I have observed both male and female managers who excelled due to their competence and commitment, not because of their gender. Furthermore, opportunities for leadership often depend on cultural and organizational factors, meaning that one group may appear more capable simply due to greater representation or support. For these reasons, I believe that making broad assumptions about gender and leadership is misleading. Ultimately, anyone can become an effective leader if they cultivate the necessary skills and qualities, regardless of being male or female."
325,2,Write about the following topic.Some people believe women are better leaders than men. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is true that gender equality has achieved significant advancements nowadays compared to society in the past, and women have no doubt obtained more opportunities to get engaged in the leading role on many occasions. With regard to many success stories about female leadership, there is a common statement that women are more suited to be leaders. In my opinion, leadership depends more on ability rather than gender.
There are several reasons why some people may consider females as the better choice to occupy the leading position. Firstly, female leadership is a relatively new trend in recent decades with the development of society and therefore has been put under the highlight. In the past, men were always seen as the superior gender to run the company and dominate the realm. At the same time, women were seldom taken into account to be qualified to do management, and in many cases, they were merely not eligible for leadership. Hence, the opportunity and success of female leadership nowadays are highly emphasized and kept firmly in people’s minds, which probably leads to the imagination that women can better lead. Secondly, the statement can sometimes be regarded as propaganda for gender equality. In order to improve public awareness of the female role in leadership and create more chances for women to partake in leading, it is surely an excellent idea to set a good image of female leadership by advocating their merits. However, the decisive factors to successful leadership, which include capacities like communication, personal charisma, and intelligence, should not be misinformed.
Despite the argument given above, I also believe that it is urgent to replace the stereotype of gender among the public, which contributes to the distinct impression of each gender about leadership. The male characteristics were traditionally defined as braveness, intelligence, and dominance, which match the requirement of leadership a lot. It is no doubt that women can be brave and able to take risks and responsibility in the leading position as well. A prime example can be female chancellor Merkel of Germany, who led the German government for more than 16 years and enjoyed a well-known reputation worldwide. Her political legend reflects the fact that the extraordinary competence of leadership does not exclusively belong to males.
In conclusion, although I completely agree that gender equality is of unparalleled importance. However, the key to successful leadership should never be related to gender.",,,,,,8.0,"The question of whether women make better leaders than men has sparked much debate in recent times, especially as more women are given opportunities to lead in both political and corporate fields. In my view, while there are compelling arguments supporting the strengths of female leaders, I do not believe leadership quality is inherently determined by gender. Supporters of female leadership often point to qualities such as empathy, collaboration, and attention to detail, which are sometimes more associated with women and can indeed benefit any leadership position. For instance, many successful businesses led by women have fostered inclusive work environments and achieved notable growth, suggesting their unique approach can be highly effective. On the other hand, it is important to acknowledge that men also possess these qualities, just as women can demonstrate assertiveness and decisiveness, traits traditionally linked to male leadership. Looking at leaders such as Jacinda Ardern from New Zealand and Barack Obama from the United States, it is clear that effective leadership comes from a blend of skills, vision, and adaptability regardless of gender. In summary, although women have proven themselves as capable and sometimes exceptional leaders, I believe that evaluating leadership should be based on personal ability and merit, not on whether someone is male or female."
327,2,Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is undeniable that nowadays, smart devices such as phones and tablets play an essential role in one's life. Through countless websites and applications, people can connect with each other without any boundaries. While many people agree that the introduction of these technologies has many disadvantages to the conservative way of starting and maintaining relationships, I personally believe that they rather develop new socializing methods.
First and foremost, social medias and applications can help with keeping in touch with acquintances. Previously, people had to follow a precise time and location to meet up with their friends as they are unable to contact the others to reschedule. However, the internet allows them to update their plans at any time. This means that if there is any emergency, an individual can immediately postpone the upcoming event and find the next available slot to continue the plan. Furthermore, there are several applications that allow people to video call their friends and family who are currently living apart.
The current technologies not only offer us options to communicate with our current contacts but also allow us to discover new friends. In the past, it is difficult to find people with a common interest which had to be done through social events. Nowadays, online communities enable their users to connect with new friends virtually. Thus, fewer individuals are left alone, especially introverts and those who are living in remote areas which can have difficulties socializing offline.
All in all, despite the fact that there are many positive impacts of the invention of social medias and communication technologies, there are also risks and downsides of using them without face-to-face communication. Therefore, the time used for socializing online and offline should always be balanced.",,,,,,7.0,"There is no doubt that developments in communication technology such as smartphones, instant messaging, and social media have significantly shifted the way people connect with one another. Some critics argue that these advancements distance individuals from genuine relationships, yet I disagree with this viewpoint. One clear advantage is that modern tools make it easier for people to stay connected regardless of distance, such as maintaining contact with friends or relatives who live far away or even in other countries. Before, people could only communicate through letters or costly phone calls, making it difficult to nurture long-distance relationships. Now, regular conversations and sharing daily experiences can happen instantly, which often strengthens bonds. Additionally, online groups and chat platforms allow users to meet new people with similar interests that they might not find locally, helping overcome social barriers and loneliness. Admittedly, some people might become overly dependent on virtual interactions, potentially leading to social isolation. However, I believe that as long as technology is used wisely, the benefits of building and preserving a variety of relationships far outweigh the potential drawbacks. In conclusion, while modern communication has changed traditional social patterns, it offers powerful ways for people to interact positively if managed appropriately."
329,2,Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?,"With the development of technology, there is a debate whether advanced communication technology would be a major contributor to worsening human relationships in modern society. In my opinion, the developing communication tool could have negative impacts on social relationships in the future. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.
To begin with, new technology could be out of control at an early phase of introduction. New technologies certainly enable us to live conveniently as a result, however, it often takes some time to fit them into our lifestyles under the control. Above all, the latest tool could bring worsened effects on society than we expect. To be more specific, bullying with the use of smartphone is one of the major problems all over the world today. It is manifest that new communication tools can easily devastate human relationships in this regard.
On the other hand, some arguments can be made that new communication tools make it possible that people across the world can have a chat without physical moving to another place. But closer examination would reveal that the introduction of new communication technology also causes fewer opportunities for people to meet up in person. A compelling example of this is that Japanese people have less relationship with their neighborhood than in the post. People living today might be satisfied with tons of telecommunication rather than direct communication. I strongly suppose this is also a negative effect on social relationships with the use of new technology.
Having considered all the above, I strongly believe that modern communication tools would lead to a negative result for social relationships because of uncontrollable aspects of the latest technology and loss of communication in person with the use of new communication tools.",,,,,,7.0,"The rapid advancement of modern communication technology has sparked debates on whether it damages the quality of our social relationships. Personally, I agree that these technologies can have negative impacts on the way people interact with each other for a couple of key reasons. The first notable problem is that people tend to communicate more through screens rather than face-to-face, which can reduce the emotional depth and understanding typically found in direct conversations. For instance, social media apps and instant messaging make it easy for people to stay in touch, but they also make it just as easy to ignore or misunderstand others, leading to more frequent conflicts or feelings of isolation. Secondly, an overreliance on technology has decreased the value placed on personal interactions; people often choose convenience over the effort of meeting in person even when living nearby. This trend is evident among teenagers who prefer chatting online over attending social gatherings, which could weaken the bonds formed in real life. In summary, while communication technology offers undeniable benefits for connecting over long distances, I believe its negative influence on the depth and authenticity of social relationships cannot be overlooked."
331,2,Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?,"Some people believe that communication technology advancement leads to social problems. I partially agree with this statement. Social media applications such as Instagram and Facebook do have a toxic influence on people's relationships. But from the other hand, communication technology enables people to communicate freely, whether a person is physically in China or in America.
The rapid blooming of social media communication tools has made people's lives easier. But, there is another side of a coin – now individuals are able to create internet pages anonymously. This function has blown up people's trust. Now everybody can create a fake page on the internet and catfish another person, without revealing her/his personality. It is definitely a negative effect on relationships between people in general.
Nevertheless, modern communication technology connected so many people. For example, relatives who are living in different countries can preserve their family connections by communicating through online services and applications. This function can help to support relationships of people who are far away from each other. Moreover, there is evidence that people have started to date each other more, because of dating applications' progress. For shy and introverted people this is an important improvement because they can start chatting online and then gradually switch to real-life communication.
To conclude, modern communication technology has both benefits and drawbacks. The most important drawback is a deterioration of social trust because of the anonymous activity. But the benefits of using communication technology outweigh all the drawbacks. Communication technology gives the possibility to communicate with relatives, who are living on another edge of the planet.",,,,,,7.0,"There are different opinions about the influence of modern communication technology on social relationships, and I mostly agree that it brings both positive and negative effects. On one hand, smartphones and instant messaging have made it possible for people to keep in touch more conveniently, especially with friends and family who live far away. This improves relationships by making communication much easier than in the past. However, there are negative aspects as well. For instance, people often spend so much time on social media or chatting online that they neglect face-to-face conversations, which can cause misunderstandings and a sense of isolation. Furthermore, people sometimes hide their true feelings behind text messages or emojis, and this can weaken the depth of real relationships. At the same time, communication technology helps many people make new friends or maintain connections that would otherwise fade, especially during times when meeting in person is difficult. In conclusion, I think modern communication technology has both helpful and harmful effects on social relationships. Although there are concerns, it still plays a crucial role in keeping people connected in today’s world."

Do you agree or disagree?,"In today's globalised world, the introduction of smart devices and the Internet have definitely changed the way mankind communicates. It is argued that negative consequences due to the modern communication technology can be shown in relationships of any kind. Although, some people may have difficulty to engage in person with others, the advanced devices allow human-being to mantain relationship around the world and improve their contact network.
People who believe that the introduction of new technology has negative effect on how we related to other could have a point. More human-beings are comfortable with new technologies due to the elimination of anxiety or stressful feelings triggered by face-to-face meetings. Moreover, modern devices allow erasing unprofessional or informal messages with a simple click of a button. Despite the fact that people might lose the ability to communicate correctly at the first attempt, these recent technologies offer more opportunity, encouraging shy and not confident personality.
The internet and modern devices connect people around the world expanding their connections through different continents. It is well known that creating a vast network of connections is crucial for buissness allowing expansion or firms merging. Not only it ease working meeting guarantee excellent performances from distance, but also this new technology are increasing connectivity between mankind so that friendship can be saved and language barriers can be a dwindle obstacle.
To conclude, I strongly believe that the modern communication technologies have a positive impact on mankind's life, improving their relationship, offering solution to less confident people and implementing network of connection among companies. Therefore, the positive effects of these new way of communicate far outweight the negative one's.",,,,,,6.0,"There is an ongoing debate about whether modern communication technology, such as smartphones and social media, is causing harm to people’s social relationships. While it is true that sometimes people use their devices to avoid face-to-face interactions, I believe the advantages of these technologies for maintaining relationships are much more significant than any drawbacks. Firstly, instant messaging and video calls allow families and friends who live far apart to stay in touch easily and frequently, helping them share important moments even from a distance. Another benefit is that social media enables individuals to reconnect with old friends and meet others who share similar interests, which can actually enrich their social lives. Even though some people may spend excessive time online and risk neglecting real-life relationships, it is a personal choice rather than a necessary result of technology. In fact, many shy or introverted people have found it easier to start conversations and build confidence through online communications. In conclusion, while there are some challenges, I am convinced that modern communication technology strengthens social bonds overall, offering people more ways to stay connected and maintain meaningful relationships regardless of distance."

Smartphone is designed to make people's life more easier, simpler, and accessible which can be used everywhere and anywhere. Many companies and organizations applied technology in our daily lives and it is called ""Internet of Things"" which connect the electronic devices to get access through the internet everywhere. This surely be a solution for everyone's to get access and communicate easier with other people inside the smartphone that has the applications that provided social media.

337,2,"Some people think history has nothing or little to tell us, but others think that studying the past history can help us better understand the present. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","With the development of technology, an increasing number of people try to acquire the latest technology such as computer programming, rather than to study history. There is a debate whether studying histroy could give us more advantages to understand the present society. In my opinion, obtaining knowledge of past history would be definitely helpful for us to live well in society today. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.
To begin with, looking back on history would give us the opportunity to notice mistakes which human beings used to make in the past. Specifically, all kinds of people and countries around the world had made innumerable mistakes throughout history. Besides, some of these mistakes might result in a huge number of victims. Therefore, human beings must avoid these tragedic events happening again. Above all, only knowing history could lead to avoidance of the recurrences. To be more specific, World War must be one of the serious events in human being history, and understanding of this truth have a significant impact on how we should live not to cause war again in the present society. It is manifest that leaning history is meaningful in this regard.
On the other hand, some arguments can be made that old stories have little something to do with our present lives. However, closer examination would reveal that all the relationships present today originally come from something in the past. Knowing history enables us to find the best way to a fruitful future. The compelling example of this is racial discrimination in the U.S. Understanding the U.S. history could give us the best manner not to deteriorate relationships in the U.S. I suppose that studying history would be helpful for all human beings from this aspect.
Having considered all the arguments above, learning history would be a major contributor to a better understanding of the present because we can know how to avoid the same mistake people used to made and how we should behave for the better result through history.",,,,,,6.5,"There are differing opinions about the value of learning history, with some claiming that the past is not relevant to current life, while others argue that understanding history is crucial for interpreting the present. Those who downplay the importance of history believe that each era faces unique circumstances and challenges, suggesting that old events or customs have little to offer in a world that continually evolves. They point out that focusing on present-day skills, such as technology or economics, is more practical for success. Nevertheless, I believe history provides essential insights that help people comprehend the roots of modern problems and prevent previous mistakes from recurring. For instance, studying how societies once handled economic crises, public health emergencies, or changes in government can offer valuable lessons that inform present decisions. Furthermore, knowing the historical context behind ongoing conflicts or social movements is important for fostering understanding and finding positive solutions in today's diverse world. In conclusion, although some may consider history irrelevant, I am convinced that learning from the past arms us with the understanding necessary to navigate the complexities of modern society effectively."
339,2,"Some people think history has nothing or little to tell us, but others think that studying the past history can help us better understand the present. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There is no argument that history is something related to the past generation which has never been seen by the present generation. which let some people think that history has nothing to teach us or has limited information. While others believe that in order to identify history we have to study it to help us in our modern lives. In my opinion, in the past even if they reach wonderful experiments it could be difficult to reach to our era. However, nowadays we are capable of knowing about the old history via modern technology.
On one hand, old people are limited by the population which let the people in the same place communicate through symbols to be aware of enemies. Towards generations, these symbols turned into history. As a result, people think that it is just a piece of art by the old people. In fact, some of these are from scientists and have been written as a symbol. Moreover, till now those shapes meant nothing to us or are just small pieces of information.
On the other hand, these days the government take a step forward and is trying hard to clarify those stones and what it means, In addition, some historical centers have scientists studying the old tools in order to have an idea from studying that symbols. For instance, Tomes Addison one of his achievement was the discovery of the light lamp which we are used to living with it. Therefore, this exploration comes from studying old history. In other words, each generation is capable to help the following generation.
In conclusion, history is an element that can not be ignored from any period, because it could have very critical information. Finally, I believe that technology helped us recently to study those strange tools. consequently, the government should pay more attention to covering the experiment's expenses.",,,,,,4.5,"Some individuals claim that history is not very useful for us today since it only tells about old events that do not affect our current lives. They argue that the problems and lifestyles of the past were so different from our own that there is little we can actually learn. For example, ancient customs or wars may seem irrelevant to modern society with its advanced technology and different values. On the other hand, there are people who believe that understanding history is essential for making sense of the present time. They point out that many of our laws, beliefs, and even conflicts have their roots in past events, so studying them can explain why the world is the way it is. Personally, I agree more with the second view because history helps us avoid repeating mistakes and shows us how society has changed. For instance, by learning about diseases in the past, scientists can better prevent outbreaks today. In conclusion, while some aspects of history might appear outdated, having knowledge of the past supports better decisions for the future."
341,2,"Some people think history has nothing or little to tell us, but others think that studying the past history can help us better understand the present. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There are two possible ways to interprete the significance of history experience for our everyday life.
The first point is to ignore the history experience. The main reason is based on the opinion that history never repeats. All historical persons that lived at the elder times never made their decisions in the conditions those surround us. The world has changed significantly. Technology, information, transport, medicine, human rights - all these important parts of our life has changed since the elder times. So, we can not directly copy the decisions of different problems of the elder times to our present life.
The second point is to use the history experience in our present life. This opinion is based on observed samples of very similar intervals of history. At different time periods in different countries there were some events or historical processes being very similar. There are a lot of examples illustrating this thought. All countries of Medieval Europe and Asia past through the feodalism period. Then leaders of that counties decided that the feodalism is not the most effective way to control the country and annuled it. Nowadays we know that experience and, I believe, there will be no attempts to buld the feodalism again. The second example is the practice of conquestions. There were a lot of great conquerrors in the world's history: Alexander Macedonian, Caesar, Chinggis-khan, Napoleon, Gitler. All the listed persons conquerred big territories, their armies were very strong. But some time past and their empires were broken. Sometimes their enemies united against the conquerrors, sometimes they just died and their successors could not save the empires. But always the empires died. Nowadays we have no any signs of old borders of that empires. Actually all state borders are based on nations' borders, not on the old conquestions.
I think the second opinion is better. The reason is following. There are a lot of institutions in our life that we like. For example, human rights, property rights, education, medicine. All these institutions appeared as a result of historical experince. If our predecessors ignored that experience, we would never live in the modern society. In that case we would have no modern medicine and education, also we would live in the society with slaver. So, I think that we should thoroughly study the historical experience and use its conclusions in our present life.",,,,,,6.5,"Some people consider history to be irrelevant for today’s society, arguing that the problems and situations of the past are quite different from those we face now. They believe that because the world is constantly changing with new technology, knowledge, and social systems, the lessons of history are outdated. According to this view, the unique events of history happened under conditions that no longer exist, so it is not possible to apply historical solutions to modern problems. However, others argue that history is very valuable because it helps us understand how current societies developed and why certain customs, laws, or conflicts exist. By learning about patterns such as the rise and fall of governments, economic crises, or struggles for freedom, we can avoid repeating past mistakes and better predict the results of our actions. There are many examples where people who ignored history ended up causing harm, such as economic disasters that came from ignoring past financial crashes or wars started because leaders did not learn from earlier conflicts. Personally, I think that while it is not wise to blindly follow old answers, we benefit greatly from studying history. It helps us learn from both mistakes and successes, and gives us guidance in understanding the world’s complex problems now."

Discuss both views.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Spending money in family celebrations can be seen as a way of appreciating where one comes from. Although some people say it is a total waste of money, l assert that it is wiser.
To begin with, many people feel that it is of no importance to consume money on family gatherings. This is because people usually have more pressing issues in life like urgent health cases that require money. Also, some struggle to provide basic needs for their families, for example, tuitions, decent meals and shelter. For these reasons, it seems using money on family gatherings is just a luxury.
Despite the merits of the arguments above, although many say it is wasteful to financially cater for family parties, l assert that it is crucial. One reason is that, it unites families and a sweet spirit is maintained if family members are recognised for their special days such as wedding anniversaries, birthdays and graduations where money is spent. Further, appreciation to others within the family cannot be expressed in many ways without forking out some money.
Furthermore, money has to be spent on family get togethers where everyone is in a joyous mood so that people can catch up and release stresses from their straining personal lives. What is more, culture, closeness and love is easily displayed when families come together for such celebrations and use money for their own satisfaction. For instance, when my childhood birthdays were celebrated, l felt so much loved and l still cherish the memories as l vividly can recall.
To conclude, although others feel that it is money consuming to fund family gatherings, l advocate that it is a wiser option. Should this be the case, love within families would not wax cold and family members would feel more appreciated.",,,,,,7.0,"Some people argue that spending significant amounts of money on family celebrations is unnecessary and perhaps even wasteful, especially given other financial priorities like education or healthcare. They think resources should be allocated to enduring needs and investments rather than fleeting events, since there are families who struggle to provide for everyday expenses and can't afford lavish gatherings. However, others believe investing in family celebrations is valuable because it strengthens bonds and creates treasured memories. Events like weddings, birthdays and anniversaries serve as opportunities for family members to come together, relax, reconnect, and show appreciation for one another, which can sometimes be hard to do in daily life. Personally, I have seen in my own family how even modest gatherings bring people closer, and the positive effects last far beyond the day itself. Additionally, these celebrations can help preserve family traditions and reinforce a sense of cultural identity. In conclusion, while spending excessively on celebrations may not be practical for everyone, dedicating some money to meaningful family occasions can have lasting emotional benefits and should not be immediately dismissed as a waste."

Discuss both views.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"This essay will talk about the importance or not of spending lots of money on family celebrations.
Family celebrations are always important, at least for catholics as it happens in my country, Spain. Nevertheless in the last decade the celebrations have started to look like something aimed to show how much money you have or you can spend. For example 30 years ago a communion celebration was a familiar meeting, going first to the church and celebrating it afterwards at home or at a restaurant with the closest members of your family. This is about to disappear. Almost every family with children receiving the communion will choose to organize a big party, inviting all family members and friends, and organizing something special for children such as going to Disneyland Park (or any other theme park). The same happens with birthday parties, it seems to be a need of improving them each year, so parents struggle to find a more original idea year by year.
On one side it is understandable, it is a human desire to celebrate family events as much as possible. I can see the point of organizing a special event for the kids in their special days (if we stick to the communion or birthay party examples). We all wish to make these days unforgettable.
But, I can´t see the point on spending so much money.
I have been a kid of the ""old school"". When I was a child there was no option, the maximum you could get from your parents was a party at home with your 3 or 4 best friends, eat losts of sweets and when geting older even a pijama party!.
In conclusion I stick to the point of less is more also in this discussion. I still believe that family celebrations must remain familiar without big events but surrounded by the ones you really love and care of.",,,,,,6.5,"There are different opinions about whether spending a lot of money on family celebrations is necessary or not. On one hand, some people feel that spending more on these occasions shows love and respect for their family, making the celebrations memorable and unique. For example, in many cultures weddings, birthdays, and anniversaries have become grand affairs, with people hiring photographers, renting big venues, and organizing costly entertainment so that everyone enjoys the moment to the fullest. On the other hand, others argue that spending so much is unnecessary and may even cause financial stress. For instance, my cousin’s family chose to celebrate her graduation at home with a simple dinner, saving money for her future studies instead of on a big party. They still had a meaningful time together, proving that celebrations can still be special without overspending. Ultimately, it seems that what matters most is not the amount of money spent, but the time shared and the feelings behind the celebration. Therefore, while elaborate celebrations can be enjoyable, I believe simple gatherings with loved ones can be just as meaningful, and families should not feel pressured to spend beyond their means."
347,2,Write about the following topic:Some people believe that it is important to spend a lot of money on family celebrations. While others think it is a waste of money. Discuss both views.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"With the development of society, people have more options for how they spend their own money compared with the previous generations. There is an ongoing debate about whether it is essential or not to invest money in family celebrations. In my opinion, spending a lot of money on family celebration would definitely bring more precious experiences to us. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.
To begin with, squandering my own money for my family is significantly meaningful. Specifically, an important person for us, such as my wife or my children, may be out of my sight suddenly someday. Nobody can predict what is going to happen in the future. Above all, regular appreciation toward them with spending a lot of money might enable us not to regret what we did to them if something tragic happened. To be more specific, a scientific report revealed that having a deep and peaceful relationship with someone ended up improving the quality of life. It is manifest that spending money on the family could bring us advantages in this regard.
On the other hand, some arguments can be made that paying money for myself is a major contributor to improving my happiness, However, closer examination would reveal that not spending a lot of money for others end up bringing us loneliness. There are a lot of things we feel satisfied with spending money for others in the world. The compelling example of this is that having a trip with someone, surely having a good relationship, enables us to feel more satisfaction than alone. I suppose that spending money for others is a key to making myself more happier.
Having all the arguments above, I strongly recommend people spend their money on family celebrations enough to make family members satisfied.",,,,,,6.0,"There are differing views about whether it is necessary to spend a large sum of money on family celebrations, such as weddings, birthdays, or anniversaries. On one hand, some people argue that spending generously makes these moments memorable and strengthens the bond between family members. They believe that special occasions are rare opportunities to show appreciation and love, and creating wonderful memories through grand celebrations can make family members feel valued. For instance, I have a friend who invested a large amount in her parents' wedding anniversary, and their happiness and the unforgettable memories shared by all attendees justified the expense. On the other hand, there are people who feel that excessive spending on such events is unnecessary and could be better used for more practical purposes, such as education, healthcare, or saving for emergencies. They argue that the real meaning of family celebrations lies in being together and showing care, which does not always require lavish spending. For example, in my own family, we often celebrate birthdays at home with home-cooked meals and simple decorations, and it still feels special because of the quality time we share. In conclusion, while it is understandable that some want to create spectacular experiences for their loved ones, I believe that the value of family celebrations is not determined by the amount of money spent, but by the love and time shared between family members."
349,2,"Write about the following topic:In many countries, not enough students study science subjects. What are the causes? What will be the effect on society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Science, as a fundamental subject, is significant for the development of technique. It contains the knowledge of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and even medicine and astronomy. Developed countries holding great power and resource probably have grand teams of science professionals. But in many countries, there are only few of students have chance to take science class and study the further professional subjects. Although this situation seems biased, but this is not a referring to that these countries are less developed. There are some possible reasons.
The basic concept of science knowledge is generally given in fundamental education of many countries. In my home country, Science is a basic subject that fixed in the fundamental education system. Students come to Science in a very young age. They gain knowledge not only from textbooks, but also from experiments, and natural activities outside the school. And this kind of forms of teaching can be seen in many countries’ fundamental education. After entering the high school, not only science subject but also almost each subject are separated to more detailed subjects. Students are asked to choose a specific subject and study it, and expected to use it to be a career choice. And this is one of the potential causes of not having many students studying Science in some countries.
In developed countries, there are plenty of vacancies in different career types. For instance, we need medical professionals such as doctors and nurses, biological professionals, and even chemical and astrological professionals in the developed society to not only maintain our daily life but also to investigate and develop more advantage for the environment we are living. While in the developing or non-developed countries, there is a huge amount of the population doing farming or working in basic industrial area, which are not necessary in the usage of Science field.",,,,,,6.0,"Science subjects are often considered essential for the progress of society, yet it is noticeable that in many places around the world, relatively few students choose to study them. There are several reasons behind this pattern. Firstly, science is often perceived as more challenging than other subjects, which discourages students who are afraid of facing difficult exams or heavy workloads. Additionally, the teaching methods used for science can sometimes focus too much on memorization rather than inspiring curiosity and practical understanding. This can make science seem dry and uninteresting compared to other more creative subjects. Furthermore, in some countries, career prospects in fields like business, law, or even the arts appear more appealing or profitable, so students choose paths that seem to guarantee a stable or more lucrative future. The effects of this trend could be significant. If too few students become scientists, engineers, or medical researchers, there may not be enough professionals to tackle important issues like disease, environmental pollution, and technological advancement. This could slow progress and make societies dependent on foreign expertise. To encourage more students to engage in science, education systems may need to make these subjects more accessible and relate them to daily life, so students can see their value and potential for improving the world."

What will be the effect on society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays, there are many courses available to take, from arts that include theatre and music to scientific topics such as mathemathics, physics, chemistry, biology and medicine. There is an evidence that the amount of students willing to learn science subjects is not sufficient. In this essay I will discuss the causes of the issue and the possible effect on society.
There are several casues for the fact that students tend to skip science subjects. First, studying science can be hard and exhausting. The complexity of some subjects such as math and physics requires from the student to study many hours at home. Secondly, there are students who do not only find those courses difficult, but also get low marks even after studying long hours. As for chemistry classes, some courses include labratory lessons which may not appeal to some students.
The importance of people having knowledge in science is great. The society relies on science on a daily basis. For instance, doctors who study medicine, must know mathematics, biology and chemistry well, because biology is relevant to the patient's body. In addition, doctors prescribe medications so they must know chemistry well. Another example is architects whose job is to plan and design buildings. Without a proper knowledge in physics, they could not plan buildings.
Discussing those facts, studying science can be challenging. However, it is vital for the society that students will study science. Without doctors, nurses, scientists and other professions that rely on science, the health of the society might be effected negatively.",,,,,,7.5,"In recent years, it has become clear that fewer students are choosing to study science subjects in many countries. One reason for this trend is that science courses are often viewed as more difficult and time-consuming compared to other subjects. For example, students studying biology or chemistry usually need to perform experiments and spend extra time understanding complex concepts, which can discourage those who are not confident in their abilities. Furthermore, many students believe that careers in science do not offer as much immediate financial reward or job security compared to other fields like business or technology, leading them to choose alternative paths. This lack of interest in science can have serious consequences for society. If fewer students graduate with science-related knowledge, there will eventually be a shortage of doctors, engineers, and researchers, which can slow down technological progress and threaten public health. In the long run, societies may become more dependent on other countries for scientific expertise and innovations. To address this issue, schools and governments should promote science education by making lessons more engaging and showing students the wide range of careers that depend on a solid understanding of science."

There are some countries that should teach science in wider range and value.
There are several reasons why this situation could happen -more specifically- in third world countries. First of all, lack of higher education cirtifactes holder or scientists in the fisrt place could be the reason for the small number of school professors teaching different kind of science subjects. Moreover, some people think of science as an additional subject rather than a basic life knowledge and point on these kind of lectures as secondary subjectes.
On the other hand, in result of the science negligence in these countries, we would see a lower awareness among the society which also affects the rate of science discovery and innovations. In another point of view, increasing the importance of science in life and schools could stimulate the creative minds to exceed further in every aspect of life. There are several suggestions in my opinion is important to implement in the educaion and parenting systems to ensure a adequate scientific base for childern and students. To begin with, we could add the basic subects in schools like; Physics, Chemistry and Biology as a start and then increase the complexity of the lessons and science theories each grade. Additionally, parents could read simple science books to their children from the very first years of life so they can have a good platform to the scientific ideas of the universe.
In conclusion, science is crucial for better life and future, specially to the next generation education systems. So, countries and leaders should enhance that side.",,,,,,6.0,"In many countries, a low number of students choose to study science subjects, and this can be traced to several main causes. Firstly, science subjects like physics, chemistry, and biology are often viewed as difficult and require strong math or problem-solving skills, which not all students are confident in. In addition, the lack of qualified teachers and poor laboratory facilities in some schools makes learning science less interesting and more challenging for students. Another issue is that in several countries, the job market does not offer enough scientific or technical opportunities, so parents and students may prefer studying subjects that seem to promise better jobs, such as finance or language studies. The effect on society of this trend can be quite serious. When fewer people study science, there are fewer future scientists and engineers, which leads to slower progress in important fields like medicine, technology, and environmental protection. This can make countries less competitive globally and hinder solutions to problems like climate change or health issues. For example, I have seen in my own country that countries with strong science education are able to produce useful inventions and improve their healthcare faster. Therefore, it is essential for governments and schools to encourage more students to take up science, perhaps by making the curriculum more engaging and linking it to real-world applications, so as to ensure a stronger and brighter future for society."

However, a lot of countries have not enough students to take part in this subject. I think that the root of this issue are money and political problems. Also, the insufficient development of science will cause some social problems.
First, to develop science, huge amount of money are required. It is necessary to establish certified facilities to provide a suitable environment for studying science and starting research. These facilities need to fulfil some international standards like ISO and IEEE which are not so easy to get, therefore the government might need to spend lots of money on building certified facilities. However, some countries dose not have such amount of money, so building certified facilities may be difficult for them to do. Second, some countries such as middle-east countries are suffering some political issues like civil war. it is difficult for them to develop science and to handle the war at the same time.
Science influence many angles of our lives. First, life will be inconvenient. For example, people living in a poor country may not have cell phone. If there is emergency that needs to be informed immediately to others, it is difficult to find them. Second, internationally, the state of country may become low because of the low living standard of populace. Business will be influenced if the country dose not have great bargaining power. All the social issues will finally affect the financial stability and cause some sorrowful tragedies.
In summary, science is a key stone to develop a wealthy country. The government can modify their strategies and improve the academic environment in studying science.",,,,,,6.5,"In many countries, there are not enough students choosing to study science subjects, and several reasons contribute to this problem. One main cause is that science can be seen as a difficult and demanding field, often requiring long hours of study and complicated experiments, which may discourage students who are worried about failing or finding the subject too challenging. Additionally, in some places, society values careers related to business, law, or arts more highly, and students might be influenced by their parents or cultural expectations to pick those paths instead. Another cause is the lack of funding for science education; schools may not have enough laboratory equipment or qualified teachers, making studying science less attractive and harder to access. As a result, if fewer students study science, society will likely face negative consequences in the future. There may be a shortage of skilled scientists, engineers, and researchers needed to solve problems like climate change, disease, or technology development, which could slow a country’s progress and lower people’s quality of life. For instance, countries that do not invest enough in science tend to rely on others for new technologies and medicines, making them less independent. Therefore, it is important for governments and educational institutions to encourage more students to pursue science for the sake of national development and global competitiveness."

The way I see this matter is there is a couple of major causes which includes the following;
Firstly, socity reasons;
Well, usually in each country pepole will lead some ideology thoughts and movments on certain topics and trends where focusing on certin major or studies considered to be the best decision that you can take which will lead to a great opportuntites for you as an indvedual and we all know that today people sees the scince as thing that will give you a knwoledge not an amazing future.
Having said that, it will directly causes an impact on the students and many of them will decides to explore another areas rather than a science subjects.
Secondly, Religious reasons
You maybe surprised to read this however, it's actullay one of the issues that causes the lack of having enough students studying science.
The best way to explain this reason is by example where in Saudi Arabia between the 1990 until 2013 a Religious were preaching peploe about the danger of studing science and that they should only focus on religion subjects.
Having that happend now will causes a lot to the society, where people will be less educated about the basics of our world.
In cunclusion, the way I see it that each countrt must enforce the studying of science subjects atleast untill the first year of college.",,,,,,5.0,"In my opinion, there are several reasons why not enough students choose to study science subjects in various countries, and these causes can significantly impact society as a whole. First of all, many students often see science as very challenging and stressful compared to other subjects, making them less motivated to take on such a difficult path. For example, students might feel anxious about the amount of math and laboratory work required in fields like chemistry or physics, so they decide to study subjects that seem easier or more creative. Secondly, some students and their families believe that science degrees do not lead to well-paid or secure jobs, especially in countries where the market is already full of graduates and opportunities are limited. This leads people to pick business, social studies, or even vocational courses that look more promising for future employment. If this trend continues, societies could face serious consequences in the future, such as a shortage of doctors, engineers, or researchers who are crucial for solving problems like diseases or climate change. As a result, innovation will slow down and the country may fall behind in important areas like technology development or health care. In summary, I think governments and schools should do more to encourage students to study science by showing them the real-life applications and job possibilities, so that society does not suffer from a lack of skilled scientists in the future."
359,2,In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"This essay will talk about the general increase in talking about money.
I will expose why I believe this is a negative development.
In worldwilde terms there has been a general society empoverishment.
In general terms, inflation has beaten the entire world very hard due to the fluctuations in energy prices, furthermore the war between Russia and Ucrania has worsen even more this fluctuation as Russia has almost stopped suppling Gas to Europe. On the other hand Ucrania was the biggest Europe´s seed warehouse and our economy at the food industry has also been affected by huge price increase.
However salaries have not been rised up enough to reach inflation rate which directly has driven society to a loss of value. This fact induces us to speak more often and more in detail about prices, about our salaries or about our home rentals. Population wonders how come our governments are not settling different actions to repair this huge loss which is causing biggest wealth inequality rates, dividing even more the society between wealthy and poors and sending a lot of population to thicken ""the under the poverty line"" population .
Newspapers and communication agencies daily inform about war status, but lately they are forgoting to insist on the economy crash we are suffering. Only in France there have been important strikes to report their disomfort with the enlargement of the retirement age as well as the general price increase.
To summarise, the economical situation worldwide is wobbling, and the least we can do is talking about it.",,,,,,5.5,"In recent times, people in many countries have begun to speak more openly about money, including how much they make or the price they paid for everyday items. One reason for this is the impact of rising living costs and economic instability, which has made people more aware and anxious about their financial situation. With inflation increasing the cost of groceries, gas, and rent, but wages often staying the same, people are naturally comparing notes with one another about how they are managing. In the past, discussions about personal income or spending were sometimes considered rude or private, but now sharing this information can be a source of comfort or a way to seek advice. However, I think this is mostly a negative trend because talking about money all the time can lead to stress, jealousy, or unhealthy competition between people. Instead of building solidarity, it might make people feel worse about their own situations or less satisfied with what they have. Although it is important to be aware of financial realities, society should also focus on values beyond just money, such as community and well-being. All in all, while it is understandable that financial topics come up more frequently, this development seems to weaken social ties rather than strengthen them."
361,2,In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"Money can not buy happiness! Is one of the most famous sayings while talking about finances. It is argued that topics around money, wealth, and poverty are becoming dramatically more frequent between humans in different countries around the world. In my opinion, the extream part of it is a negative development; although, it has some positivities. I will address some of both sides in this essay.
Talking about money during the major part of the day might make the person look stingy and this is an attitude that majority of the community would not like, thus, might effect on the person's social life. Moreover, having the same topic in mind all day might lead to an obsession, and as a result, this could lead to a depression because the person might not find the proper way to reach to the financial position that meets their satisfaction, which could lead to depression, or even worse such as going through illegal paths where it could destroy their lives entirely!
Nevertheless, the person should be aware of his /her income and spendings and try to enhance their financial position to the best possible way. Also, the inflation that we are currently living and the noticable increase in prices could be a driver for people to talk about money more often.
In conclusion, people should not be obssessed in money and to talk with everyone about it all the time. However, I believe that people should discuss this matter in order to benefit from each other, and to find more ways to enhance their quality of life.",,,,,,7.0,"It has become increasingly common for people in many countries to frequently discuss money in their daily interactions, whether it is about how much they earn or what they spend on different things. I believe this trend has emerged mainly because the cost of living keeps rising and financial pressures are now a part of most people’s lives. In addition, social media and the internet make it normal for individuals to share their salaries or compare expenses with others. However, I think there are both positive and negative aspects to this development. On the positive side, being open about financial issues may help people become more aware of budgeting, saving money, or making smart investments; it might also reduce the stigma around financial struggles and help people find solutions together. On the other hand, focusing too much on money can cause stress or jealousy among friends, and people might start measuring self-worth based only on earnings or purchases. In summary, while discussing money openly can provide valuable information and support, it is important not to let these conversations dominate our lives or relationships, as too much attention on finances could harm our mental health and social connections."
363,2,In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"Increasing in interests about money happened in many countries worldwide. Obviously, aguements about wage and income has become popular topics for people. This essay will demonstrate reasons behide this and some possible consequences followed the statement.
To begin, in the modern world, social media plays a major role in which people, younger generation in particular, communicate with others. This can be a dominant cause leading to daily conversations about financial issues. For example, a plenty of contents posted on digital platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, are related to financial knowledge. This perhaps normalize the topics about financial to be more acceptable than in the past.
Furthermore, luxury products have become an indicator of social status for younger generation. With tons of advertisements involved in every kinds of medias, people tend to spend their wealth on artificial things more and more. For instance, I experienced with a few individuals saving over a half of their monthly income to be able to purchase a high-end watch.
Although having converstions about money might help people to understand deeper about money management and how improve themselves to get higher wage, this could lead to overspendings which could have a huge negative effect.
In conclusion, it seems to me that a widely used of social media and advertisements of luxury products are two major causes of a rising in popurlarity of talking about money. On one hand, the situation can help equip people with better knowledge about money management and self-improvement. On the other hand, daily discussions about money has a potential to raise an importance of external artificial objects.",,,,,,6.0,"In today’s society, it has become increasingly common for people in many countries to frequently discuss money, such as how much they make or the price paid for goods and services, in everyday conversations. Several reasons explain this trend, including the influence of social media, greater transparency in workplaces, and a growing interest in personal finance. Social media has made it easier to compare lifestyles, salaries, and spending habits by constantly exposing users to others’ lives, which can lead to more open discussions about financial matters. Additionally, as people strive for better work conditions and wage equality, sharing information about income has become more acceptable as a way to address unfairness. While these conversations can encourage better financial education and greater awareness about the cost of living, they can also create unhealthy comparisons and increased pressure to keep up with others. Overall, discussing money more openly is a mixed development: it may have positive effects by promoting transparency and knowledge, but it may also increase materialism and stress among individuals."
365,2,In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"In modern society, most people believe that money is as important and indispensable as water. As a result, in many countries, people talk more and more about money, such as how much they earn or pay for things in everyday conversation).
This phenomenon, I think is a negative development. And I have three reasons for this:
1. Inner hypocrisy;
2. Lack of confidence in oneself;
3. Thinking and vision.
First of all, the inner hypocrisy. Many young people like to talk to their friends about how much they earn and how many expensive things they buy. At the college reunion, everyone should introduce himself or herself. For example, what kind of work he or she is doing now; Recently bought a house and a car somewhere, and then has to recommend it to others. The core purpose is to say ""I've made millions in just a few years and bought a house and a car."" Although they look nice on the outside, they are empty inside. Therefore, the inner hypocrisy is because they are empty in their heart and have nothing else to compare with others. They can use the money to make up for and satisfy their inner emptiness, and only in others can they find their sense of existence, recognition, and attention to themselves.
Secondly, I am not confident in myself. Many elderly people like to chat about their children while playing cards under the community pavilion. For example: if your child is married; How much does your child earn in a month; Did your child buy you anything expensive? If you answer in the negative, you will be looked down upon, even saying, ""Your children are working such long hours for so little money and they don't buy you anything nice."" These people often talk about it because they are not confident in themselves and they know that their children are inferior in abilities and other aspects. In other words, they are uncertain and reckless. So they like to show off in front of each other and want to prove themselves and their ability to each other.
Finally, the thinking and vision are not high. Every country or place has different classes of people, such as those living in rural China and; Paternal (they all lived in the past); on the surface look good in every way, but only after material things. Because they think money is the most important, money can do a lot of things, and only money can give them a sense of security. As can be seen from this, a person's circle of friends and living environment can determine a person's thinking and vision, so, only if your surroundings are positive, can attract more positive people like you.
In a word, if a person always talks about money, it shows that he is hypocritical inside, not confident in himself, thinking and vision are not high. So. Be sure to constantly improve your thinking and vision, constantly improve your ability in all aspects, and even keep positive at all times, so that not only can attract more people like you, but also your future life will be better.",,,,,,6.0,"In recent years, it has become increasingly common for people in many countries to discuss money openly, whether it is about salaries, the cost of items, or their financial plans. This shift, in my view, is mostly a negative development for several reasons. Firstly, frequent conversations about money can lead to unnecessary comparison and competition among individuals. For example, people might feel pressured to measure their success against others based on how much they earn or spend rather than personal growth or happiness, which can undermine self-esteem and breed jealousy. Secondly, constant focus on finances in daily discussions often indicates a growing materialistic attitude, where people value possessions and wealth over relationships and personal fulfillment. This can weaken genuine connections between friends or family, as people may judge each other based on material milestones rather than character. Lastly, talking too much about money can create social divides and reinforce stereotypes, making those who earn less or spend less feel excluded or inferior. In conclusion, while it is normal to care about financial stability, making money a constant subject of conversation tends to promote negative values, hinder deeper connections, and create unnecessary social pressures, so it is better to focus on other meaningful aspects of life."
367,2,In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"It is a face that people love to talk about money such as income and price of things in this modern society. In my view, there are some reasons in both physical and mental aspects, and it will bring about negative effect if it develop deeply.
Money is required when we live in this society while we have limited ability to earn money. Therefore, realistically, all of us cannot avoid to count our money when we spend it. Also, in macro view, the government also care about it. the figure of GPD issues every year for measuring wealth of a country. Populace pay attention in it not only because of the international state of a country but also because of the welfare of people. Regarding mental reasons, people generally think that the ability of earning money is related to the success of their life. Moreover, people like competition. So we always compare our level of income with our friends or companions.
However, I think that this is a negative development when people deeply concentrate in it. First, I do not agree that money is everything. As a human being, embodying ""freedom"" is the highest value in our live. So I believe that accomplishing the mental achievements is more important that physical target. Otherwise, people will become heartless because they think that money is the only criteria for measuring how useful of a human. For example, we can help and take care of others as volunteers without any payment, and turn the topic of conversation from money to life.
In summary, Although money is necessary in our daily life, it turn us to be ruthless if we cannot control it well. So we can do some meaningful events with our friends rather than talking too much about money.",,,,,,6.5,"In recent years, it has become common for people in many countries to speak openly about topics like salaries and the cost of goods in daily conversations. There are several reasons behind this trend, both practical and psychological. As living costs rise and people face economic pressures, discussing money has become a way to share experiences or seek advice on financial matters. Additionally, social media often encourages individuals to display their lifestyles, making earnings and spending more visible and talked about. Psychologically, earning more money is commonly associated with success, so people may naturally want to compare incomes as a form of self-evaluation or competition. However, I think that this growing tendency has more negative than positive effects. When too much focus is placed on money, important values like friendship, kindness, and personal growth can be overshadowed by material concerns. This can increase jealousy, reduce happiness, and even damage relationships. Therefore, while some financial discussions are necessary, it is better if people avoid overemphasizing money and remember to prioritize the non-material aspects of life."
369,2,In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"As we are living into a monetary society, it's unavoidable for people to discuss about money matters in daily conversation about housing mortgage, salaries and other living expenses. The financial anxiety has become a main source of headache that lingers on especially for the young generation who has to bear the increasing burden of a city life. From a standpoint of a college student, I believe it's not a postive development that should have occurred in our modern society.
When our conversation turns to money issues, it doesn's really help up with our status quo, but only further exacerbates social anxiety by unnecessay comparison and higher expectation. I personally have similar experiences when friends start to talk about their monthly pocket money and daily luxuries they prefer. We are widely variated in family background, social classes and opportunities. If our daily social discourses are always filled with monetary issues, it is only widening the social gaps between different groups of people and making our society a place less inclusive for underprevilaged people.
Additionally, money-oriented conversations might as well shape our world perspective into a very pratical, highly self-interested and boring one, which is full of daily trifles and calculation.

So I would really like to call on more people to rid money discussions our of their daily chats and share more about what's interesting in their seemingly mundane lives, some recent photos of an outing, newly met friends and others. Create meanings of life not through talks about money, but upon something more important to our own existance.",,,,,,5.5,"In recent years, there is a noticeable trend in many countries where people more frequently bring up money topics, such as salaries, rent, and expenses, during everyday conversations. I think this is largely due to rising living costs and economic uncertainty, which forces people to be more conscious of their financial situations and compare notes with others for reassurance or advice. However, I do not think that this is a healthy development. When people focus too much on how much they earn or spend, conversations can quickly turn competitive, leading to feelings of inadequacy or jealousy, especially among those who earn less or struggle financially. This behavior, in my point of view, also makes social interactions more superficial, because everything begins to revolve around numbers rather than shared interests or genuine connections. Besides, emphasizing money too much can erode important values like humility, generosity, and solidarity, replacing them with materialistic goals. I believe that while it is practical to occasionally discuss financial matters, turning money into a daily topic of conversation makes society colder and distances us from the real joys and meanings of life, such as friendship, creativity, and kindness. Therefore, I hope people will remember to talk about dreams, challenges, and happy moments more, and let discussions about money take a back seat in our interactions."

The root of this growing trend is likely the rising cost of living and the increasing pressure people feel to earn enough to keep up with their peers. Especially among young people and working adults, personal finances are often top of mind, as wages may not rise as quickly as prices for rent, food, or leisure activities. While it is understandable that people feel the need to discuss these concerns, I think the continual focus on money in conversation is mostly negative. When talk always returns to salaries and purchases, it can reinforce social divides and cause jealousy or insecurity, especially for those who feel they have less than others. Furthermore, judging people’s worth or success by how much they spend or earn makes our relationships shallower, since we might overlook more meaningful qualities like generosity, creativity, or kindness. If we could shift the focus of our conversations to hobbies, family, or hopes for the future, society would feel friendlier and less competitive, and everyone could feel more valued for who they are instead of for the size of their bank account."
373,2,In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?,"Material achievement has been discussed at a high frequency in some countries; people widely involve this topic in every aspect of their lives. This essay will give two possible reasons for this phenomenon and explain the negative impacts on society.
Two major causes keep people lingering on this topic. Firstly, the difficulties in earning a living in some countries have significantly drawn people's focus on finance. For instance, more job opportunities are needed for job seekers in countries with low productivity. Besides that, in many low-income countries, people have to endure low pay; in some extreme cases, their earnings can not cover their spending. Therefore, tremendous anxiety cause people from these countries constantly talk about their financial situations.
On the other side, flaunting is becoming the mainstream mindset in some countries. Commonly, in some countries that just escaped poverty, the increasing spared money makes showing off possible. People in these countries display their wealth by owning luxurious items, such as branded bags or jewelry. Therefore, money naturally becomes essential in their conversations.
Although the reasons for money focusing vary, it might develop into risky societal factors. If the frequent discussion of finance is due to insufficient employment or inadequate wages, it is an alarm to the governments to carry on measures of boosting industries' development. Otherwise, riots might be expected and harm social safety. Furthermore, this widespread discussion highly leads to material comparison, which harms morality and even allows crimes to occur. When individuals obsess with showing off, they feel the shame of disposing of the downsides. To maintain a perfect image- especially a wealthy appearance, some people even turn to crime, such as stealing or robbery.
To conclude, folks popularly discuss money for various reasons, such as the demands of work or psychological factors. However, the phenomenon is not a positive sign to society and most likely indicates the upcoming crisis.",,,,,,8.5,"In recent years, discussions surrounding income and expenditures have become much more common in daily interactions across many countries. This trend could be attributed to a couple of main causes. Firstly, the rising cost of living coupled with economic instability has prompted individuals to be more concerned about their financial well-being, and this anxiety is naturally reflected in conversations. Many people worry about meeting basic needs like rent, food, and healthcare, so asking about wages or the price of goods allows them to compare and evaluate their own situations against others. Additionally, the rise of social media and consumer culture has accelerated the urge to display material success. People often feel pressured to share or compete over their possessions and lifestyle, incorporating topics like salaries or big purchases into casual talk. While some might argue that such transparency could foster practical knowledge-sharing, the overall effect tends to be negative. Constant financial comparisons can breed jealousy, reduce authentic relationships, and promote a culture centered on material wealth, as opposed to values like kindness or integrity. Ultimately, while economic realities and social pressures drive people to frequently talk about money, this focus is likely to harm societal cohesion and personal well-being rather than contribute positively."
375,2,Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"In recent years, in some countries, including Japan, some people believe that governments should cover all tuition fees for students who are willing to study at university. Although the total cost will be massive and the governments need to increase the tax on citizens, I strongly agree with this opinion.
To begin with, it is absolutely unfair for students who need to give up going to university because of a lack of money. In Japan, they need to terminate to pursue their study at university, there are many students who study diligently though. If the government supported them financially, those who terminated their study could have continued studying and had the great job opportunities they hoped for.
In addition, some developed countries have been suffering from depopulation so there are some industries, such as IT, and Civil engineering that chronically have a problem with how to improve the shortage of employees. If governments encourage students to study these industries at university for free, the companies will be not only helpful to increase the number of employees, and also effective for students to obtain some qualifications in advance in university. This
means that the companies do not necessarily spare longer training time than usual for new employees.
Furthermore, economic growth is linked inextricably with education. If all students could have a variety of courses at university for free charge, they will be able to obtain skillful techniques and plenty of knowledge to pursue their career opportunities regardless of age. In addition, they will be able to study with working at the same time with light-hearted such as nighttime courses, and weekend courses. If they could work and study flexibly, they will obtain more creative ideas to improve their work. If they are required to pay more tax due to the education fee by governments, they are more than happy to pay the tax for themselves and other ambitious students.
In conclusion, the free education system in universities must be advantageous to improve their countries' economic growth in the long term.",,,,,,5.5,"In recent times, the question of whether governments should fund the entire university education for students has sparked widespread debate. Personally, I completely agree that governments should pay all university tuition fees for those who wish to pursue higher education. First of all, financial obstacles are a main reason why talented and motivated students abandon their education. In many countries, including my own, the high cost of university means bright young people from low-income families cannot afford to enroll, which limits their future and the country’s pool of skilled workers. If tuition were covered by the government, those students would gain access to opportunities they deserve, and society would benefit from their skills. Moreover, there is a clear connection between a nation’s economic development and its education level. By enabling more students to complete university, governments can create a more educated workforce, which attracts investment and innovation, especially in industries where employee shortages are common. Some worry about the burden on taxpayers, but the advantages, such as increased productivity and less reliance on social welfare, will likely outweigh the costs in the long term. Furthermore, when university education is available to all without financial stress, students can focus on learning rather than working part-time jobs, and they can choose fields based on their passions and talents, not just on salary prospects. For these reasons, I believe that free university education is a critical step towards both fairness and national prosperity, and governments should take responsibility for all course costs."
377,2,Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Regarding the suggestions that governments should offord the tuition subsidies to cover the cost of full classes, I could only partially agree due to various drawbacks derived from policies as such.
To begin with, higher educational levels is essential for young individuals in poor families reverse their situation, not only for themselves but for their families. In this case, governments have obligations to ensure the right of them to pursue higher education without the financial concerns. For example many university students nowadays have more than one part-time jobs since they need to support themselves financially, which left no time for them to concentrate on studies.
On the other hand, despite free ethic education could benefit a great number of students in need, the huge costs to maintain a functional educational institution should not be overlooked, by removing tuition fee in universities completely, it could derives various downsides, including lower quality of education and slower progresses of local constructions and developments caused by the shortage of budgets. Take the UK as an example, private schools are able to provide more educational materiols and professional educators, compared to public schools, which have high tendency classes, and outdated teaching equipments.
To summerrise, in my perspective, the right for students to study in universities is crucial, since it could not only cultivates talents who are able to contribute to societies, but allows them to bring their families out of poverty. However, people should not be ignoranced for the negative affects derived from removing tuition fee entirely, such as poor quality of teaching. Therefore, I could only partially agree with such opinions.",,,,,,6.0,"When considering whether governments should cover the entire cost of university tuition for all students, I find myself partly supporting this idea while also recognizing potential disadvantages. Undoubtedly, providing full financial support would greatly assist those from underprivileged backgrounds in gaining access to higher education, ensuring that personal circumstances do not become obstacles to academic achievement. Many students feel immense pressure due to high tuition costs, often leading them to commit to demanding part-time work that distracts from their educational pursuits. However, offering free university for everyone could pose significant financial strain on the government’s limited resources, possibly resulting in budget cuts to other vital areas such as healthcare or infrastructure. Additionally, making university entirely free might lead to overcrowded classes and a reduction in overall educational quality, as more students would enroll without necessarily being motivated or prepared for the challenges of higher education. In summary, although abolishing tuition fees could open doors for many deserving students and help promote social equity, there are also important drawbacks that need to be carefully weighed, such as sustainability and the risk of diminishing educational standards. Thus, I can only partially agree that governments should pay all university tuition fees."
379,2,Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"This essay agrees on the need of that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities, but always under one premise: those students should have demonstrated their capability to comply with university studies successfully.
There are countries, for example Scandinavian countries, where their government helps students by giving them specific students' loans. These loans have special characteristics such as long loan terms and low interest rates. It is not for free, but at least a higher number of students can have access to upgrade their studies.
And in many other European countries university fees are not large, so most of the students can access to bachelor studies. What it's not easy is having the needed qualification you need to access to the specific university study you want.
If we talk in worlwide terms, university studies are limited to wealthy people.
In fact I read only a couple of weeks ago that only a 17% of worlds' population have university studies. There is a contradiction between developped and non developped countries. As an example, in most countries in Europe we have too many university students. Actually they cannot find a job easily at their own country and sometimes they emigrate to another country in Europe or outside Europe. Furthermore vocational workers such as plumbers, waiters or receptionists can't be found, there no unemployment in vocational work!.
The opposite happens in non developped countries. As university studies have large fees, almost nobody can access to them, and vocational workers suffer unemployment, so they need to emigrate to other countries to find jobs.
To summarize, I believe fees should not be an obstacle to study in a university. The obstable should be your previous califications.
Education and Health, as much as a country can hold them, should be available for all population, poor and wealthy, with non differentiation.",,,,,,5.5,"This essay supports the idea that governments should pay the full course fees for students wishing to attend university, but also believes there should be some guidelines to ensure this support goes to those who truly need it and are committed to their education. In several countries, such as Germany or Norway, higher education is free or very low cost for all, which allows more young people the opportunity to gain important knowledge and skills, not just the ones from wealthy families. On the other hand, high fees in countries like the United States mean that taking on big student loans is the only way for many students to attend university, which can cause stress and financial troubles long after graduation. However, I think that if governments pay all course fees, they should set some criteria, such as academic performance or financial background, so the system remains fair and sustainable. Also, it is important to encourage students to go into fields that society needs most, and to offer support for vocational training as well, not only university studies. In the end, making university education accessible for all people, regardless of money, helps create a more equal and educated society, which benefits everyone in the long run."
381,2,Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Education is an important requirement for students establishing their future, thus there is a considerable debate about whether the government should give fully supported payment for university courses to people who want to study at there. In my view, I partially agree with this statement because this is a beneficial scheme, but the selection of scheme participants is required for filtering those who really need this assistance.
On the one hand, it is a definite good plan for those families are low income. A completed bachelor's degree course may cost over 10 thousand dollars. However, some grassroots families are hard to afford it. So they may tend to not study at universities but find a job for earning money. After that, college may lose some potentially intelligent students. Therefore, if this scheme can be implemented successfully, those students will show their ingenuity and get higher academic achievement, finally giving back to society when they succeed.
On the other hand, this scheme is not suitable for everyone. qualification checking is needed for choosing someone who truly aspires to an opportunity to study at college. For example, setting a line indicating the limit of the monthly income of a family is a way for the government to distinguish who is needed to help. Because the cost of the study is also a type of ""inspiration"" for students studying harder. If a family was proven to be able to afford the fees, the government would not give assistance to them in order to avoid abusive use.
In summary, although this scheme is advantageous for low-income families, revealing their children's inherent power, the government can set some rules for filtering those who are necessary for help.",,,,,,7.0,"The question of whether governments should pay all university fees for students has become a major topic in recent years. In my opinion, I mostly agree with this proposal, but I believe it should not be applied identically to every student. Firstly, supporting students from less privileged backgrounds can help ensure that everyone has a fair chance to attend university. Without such financial help, many talented young people might have to give up on their educational dreams simply because their families cannot afford the cost, which can reach tens of thousands of dollars for a full course. Helping these students not only benefits them, but it can also bring more skilled workers and thinkers back to society in the future. However, I think if the government covers all fees for every student, including those from wealthy families, it may not be the best use of public resources. It is important to focus the support on those students who need it most, perhaps by having a system to check financial backgrounds or require certain academic achievements. For students who can manage the cost, some level of personal investment may also lead to greater motivation and commitment. In conclusion, while government funding can open the door for many deserving students, it would be more effective if such help is directed towards those who truly require financial support to access higher education."
383,2,Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Nowadays many people argue that univerties graduation should be sponsouring by governments institution in other to provide this level of education for each one who desires it. I disagree with this argument as, in my opinion, isn't a governments role provide a higher education for the whole society.
First of all, the most important government task is guarantee a better level of basic education. So having great public schools to fundamental level, enable all students to been accept or get the approval for any univerties and even to requires a schoolarship, when it is necessary. Governments shouldn't spend public money in graduation or higher level education, in order to keep all efforts on be the number one in fundamental education.
Another public politic which may shows a good results is provide a specials credit lines for students who haven't enouth money to pay full tuition fees. These type of credit might create a sense of responsability and encourage students to loooking for a good job as soon as they've concluded the course. This kind of financial should consider that payment only starts after the end of their course.
In conclusion, I would argue that having the government paying the fees for university studies isn't looks to be a good solution to guarantee an university access for whole population. States should keep investing and execute their role to persue the best fundamental public education and might enable their students to get into any university. If those student haven't enouth money or condition to pay all fees, states only need to provide a special credits to them.",,,,,,5.5,"In recent years, there has been much discussion about whether governments should cover all university tuition fees for students wishing to pursue higher education. While this idea promises to make university accessible for everyone, I do not fully support it. One important reason is that governments have limited resources and must prioritize providing excellent primary and secondary education so all children get a strong start. If they spend too much on university tuition, they may have less money for schools, hospitals, and infrastructure that benefit more people. Additionally, paying students’ full fees might reduce their motivation to work hard or value the opportunity of higher education. Alternatively, governments could offer scholarships to those who truly need financial help and create loan programs that students can repay when they graduate. This way, the support is targeted and encourages responsibility. In conclusion, I believe it is better for governments to invest most in basic education and provide special support, rather than pay everyone’s full university fees."
385,2,Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Going to university is an important step in life. It will majorly impact their futurs, and will define them in many ways. Unfortunatly, this is an expensive task that not everyone can afford. Thit is the reason why some people think that governments should pay course fees for university students. In this essay, I will explain why I think governments should help students of universities financially by paying their course fees.
To begin with, this could make universities more inclusive and help some students achieve their dreams. Some people, due to their economic background, are forced to attend specific establishments, even though they would give anything to be somewhere else. This is an important cause of class differences, and the source of many disciminations today. This is why, offering to pay for their course fees, would considerably help students that are less wealthy, and fight against inequalities.
To illustrate this argument, here is an example. Some of my class-mates receive a specific amount of money from an organization, that helps them study at my shool. They find it amazing because, now they are not only defined by their parents' income anymore, and they have the opportunity to accomplish whatever they wish in life.
Secondly, an enormous amount of students live in a precarous situation, so by paying their course fees they could have a more stable life. University life is rough, you are not with your family, you have to manage so many different things for the first time, one of which being money. Some students have little to no money that they can spend in recreational activities, a big part of it being assigned to accomodations, school fees and food. By paying some of their fees, students could benefit from the money and do what they enjoy. This could help them mentally and make them enjoy life a bit more.
On the other hand, I can understand that if governments had to pay for the course fees of every students, it would represent a tremendous amount of money that could be invested in other and more pressing matters. Although, I do still think that providing this aid could have more benefits than downsides.

First, not everyone has a family that can afford the high price of higher education, and the cost of courses alone stops many smart and motivated young people from ever getting a college degree. In this way, the current system blocks people from reaching their full potential just because of money, which is unfair and unhelpful for society. For instance, when I look at communities where more financial support is offered to students, I see that more students continue their studies and many of them end up helping the community in important ways, like becoming doctors or engineers. On top of that, studying at university is already stressful, and students who worry about paying for their classes cannot focus completely on learning. Sometimes, they even have to work jobs at the same time, which makes their studies harder and lowers their chances of success. Of course, I understand that paying all course fees is costly, but investing in education means investing in the future of the country. Educated citizens are essential for a strong economy and a healthy society. In conclusion, I think the government paying for all university fees would allow more people to succeed and make life better for everyone in the long run."

Some people believe that the government should cover all course fees for those who want to attend university, and I fully support this idea. Firstly, paying for students' university education would make higher learning more accessible to everyone, not just those who can afford it. This would reduce inequality and ensure that talented individuals from low-income families have the same opportunities as others. For example, one of my friends had to give up her dream of becoming a doctor because her family simply could not afford the tuition, which I think is unfair. If the government paid her course fees, she would have been able to pursue her goals and maybe contribute to society in important ways. Secondly, without the stress of paying for expensive courses, students could focus more on their studies and their personal development. It is common for university students to take on part-time jobs just to cover fees, which can cause stress and affect their grades. If governments paid these fees, students would have more time and energy to dedicate to learning and self-improvement. Of course, some people argue that paying for everyone’s university education could put a strain on the country’s budget, but I believe that investing in education leads to a more skilled and productive workforce in the future, which benefits the society as a whole.

Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is believed that governments ought to pay full institutional fees for students who want to obtain higher education. I would say that I strongly agree with this statement.
To start with, the cost of course fees nowadays is much higher than it used to be a decade ago. One of the biggest problemss for school leavers is to manage to collect a huge amount of money that is needed in order to enter the university of your dream. Of course there are some scholarships that are very helpful. But the problem is that they are only available for very talented students who scored only high grades during their educational process, or for those who come from low-income families. As the result, students who have passion and necessary skills can not afford to study in the university.
On the ohter hand, paying for everyone's course fee would lead to a huge hole in every government's budget. The possibility of free studying for everyone sounds naive and kind of impossible. Another problem is that those students who are more likely not to participate well during their studies and might drop off the university after the first year will have an opportunity to enter universities. This will likely lead to problems with whole educational system. The only solution is to select wisely whether this or that student is ready to spend his or her time studying new knowledge and skills.
In conclusion, paying for course fees is a good idea but only for those students who have enthusiasm for studying",,,,,,6.5,"Some argue that university tuition should be fully funded by the government for all students who wish to pursue higher education. I partially agree with this view. On the one hand, the rising expenses of higher education make it increasingly difficult for students from average and even middle-class backgrounds to afford university, let alone those from low-income families. By funding tuition fees, the government can help create a fairer society with more equal opportunities, enabling talented individuals to reach their potential regardless of their financial situation. However, there are also potential drawbacks to this policy. Covering tuition for all students would require a significant financial commitment from the government, possibly diverting resources from other important sectors such as healthcare or infrastructure. In addition, when education becomes completely free, some students might take it for granted, leading to academic underperformance or higher dropout rates. Therefore, while I believe that the government should reduce the financial barrier to higher education, especially for those in need or who show promise, I do not think making tuition free for everyone is the best solution. There should be a balanced approach in which financial aid is offered to those who truly require it, so that higher education is accessible without being a burden on the state."

Discuss both views and state your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","I partially agree to the opinion that hosting an international sports event has positive effects for the country. In most cases It is good for the country as it gives a chance to show off the nation's culture and power, but sometimes the cost of holding the event outnumber the benefits from it. I will break down my opinion here with the examples of Seoul Olympic in 1988 and Tokyo Olympic in 2021.
Seoul Olympic was held in 1988 in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. It gave the nation great chance to advertise its prosperity. Many audiences got deep impression on how the country erected from the ashes of Korean war. In addition, the event had an important meaning in diplomacy, as it was an Olympic game that all communist and capitalist countries gathered after a long time. The event was prepared firmly, as South Korean knew how much this game was important to them. South Korea can earn lots of reputation, as well as money from many foreign travellers
On the other hand, Tokyo Olympic was held in 2021, in the middle of pandemic because of Covid-19. It was originally planned to be held in 2020, but postponed because of the danger of mass infection. This delay costed a lot of money to the hosting country. In addition, there were many problems in preparing the event, because of the spread of the disease. Moreover, only small amount of travellers can visit Tokyo to see the game, because of the tight regulations on travel to prevent international transmission of the disease. As a result, the money earned during the game was much less than the cost to prepare it, and its advertising effect was minor.
As we can see in these two cases, hosting an international sports event can be good in some cases, but it can be wasteful in other cases. The success in hosting international games depends on many elements. Time of the game is important, and global atmosphere is important as well. Most of all, how well the country is prepared is a key factor that the event can be successful.",,,,,,6.0,"There are different opinions about whether hosting an international sports event is beneficial to a country, and both sides provide valid points. On the positive side, organizing such an event can bring a country global attention, foster national pride, and boost the local economy. For example, when Brazil hosted the FIFA World Cup in 2014, the country saw a surge in tourism and investment, and many Brazilians felt united celebrating their national team. However, critics argue that these benefits are often short-lived and may not justify the costs. The same World Cup left some Brazilian cities with expensive stadiums that were barely used afterwards, and many people protested against the government’s spending priorities when basic needs like education and healthcare needed more support. After considering both views, I believe that while hosting an international sports event has the potential for positive impacts, the decision should depend on whether the country can realistically afford the costs and plans effectively for long-term benefits beyond the event itself."

From my point of view, It is a brilliant idea for the country and for citizens when they host and are owners of international sports events.
On the one hand, arranging a sport event is always hugely expensive. In democratic societies there is always a doubt if these expenditures are appropriate or not. Sometimes it could be thought-provoking about spending this money on charity, medical insurance or to reduce juvenile delinquency for example. Also, there are people who are not fans or spectators, for them this kind of expensive event is not interesting. For instance, in Russia it is a fact that the winter olympic games in 2014 had a lot of controversial ideas about whether it was really necessary or not. I remember that in that time were a lot of discussion in TV and in the internet,
On the other hand, when your country hosts an international sport event it is a nice chance to show how rich your country is and express solidarity in your society. It is a fact that events like this, for example ""eurovision"" or ""olympic games"" and other worldwide events help to create an interconnection between countries and cultures. During these events we can see what happens in other countries and how people there live. For example, in 2018 Russia hosted a world football games, and this event invited a large number of foreign specialists and investors.
In conclusion, although hosting international sport events could be very expensive, the benefits which it could give to the citizens and to government institutes overload any disadvantages. I believe that each country should try to do it more.",,,,,,7.0,"On one side of the debate, some people argue that hosting an international sports event provides many advantages for the host country. Firstly, such events can boost the local economy through the influx of tourists, which leads to increased spending on hotels, restaurants, and transportation. Hosting also allows a country to improve its infrastructure, such as building better roads and sports facilities, which benefits citizens long after the event is finished. A good example of this is the 2012 London Olympics, which contributed to urban regeneration and brought attention to the city. However, others believe that the negative sides outweigh the positives. They point out that the cost of organizing these events is extremely high, and often the money could be used in more urgent areas like healthcare and education. In some cases, stadiums and facilities become useless after the event, turning into ""white elephants"" and putting more financial burden on the country. For example, after the Athens 2004 Olympics, many facilities were left abandoned, causing people to question if it was a wise investment. In my opinion, while there are risks and challenges, the opportunity to bring people together and put the country on the world stage is a unique experience that can lead to lasting benefits, provided there is careful planning and consideration for long-term use of resources."

While there are little advantages for some countries throwing such a sports event, I am convinced that holding an international sports event benefits the hosting country.
On the one hand, there are several reasons why in some situations people think it is bad for a country to host an international sports event. In the first place, average people draw more attention to daily necessities and medical treatments. They believe hosting such an event is of little value compared with basic infrastructure and amenities. Instead, they hold that if invested in economic development and recovery, the good effects will be doubled. Presumably, if a country , like Afghanistan and Iraq, host an international sports event regardless of its capacity, the country will lose its people's faith because after a war, people all want to fill their belly and want the famine to be eradicated.
On the other hand, throwing an international sports event can be a great means of developing a country's economy. Hosting an international sports event spurrs the economy and provide large quantities of employment for people, which revives and thrives all various industries. Apart from that, a sports event held by a country advocates the theme of health and sports, encouraging people there to lead a green positive attitude towards life, as well as setting up its renowned international position. Therefore, after the event, excellent businessman and geniuses all around the world will be attracted to invest there.
In conclusion, I can understand why people are unwilling to hold an international sports event, but it seems to me that more advantages of hosting one event like that outweigh than that of not conducting one.",,,,,,6.5,"Opinions differ about whether hosting an international sports event is beneficial or harmful for the host country. On one hand, opponents argue that such events require substantial investment in facilities, security, and infrastructure that could otherwise be directed toward more urgent concerns such as education, healthcare, and poverty reduction. They fear that, especially for developing countries, the enormous costs may not be recovered, as experienced by countries like Brazil after the Olympics, leading to underused stadiums and financial burdens. On the other hand, supporters believe that organizing an international sports event brings global attention, boosts tourism, and creates jobs for local people. It can be a catalyst for modernizing cities and fostering national pride, as well as encouraging local people to participate in sports and adopt healthier lifestyles. For instance, the 2012 London Olympics provided a significant economic boost and improved the city's transport networks, which benefited residents long after the games ended. In my view, while there are certainly risks involved, a well-planned international sports event can deliver long-term advantages that outweigh the drawbacks, especially if the country ensures proper budget management and legacy planning."

Nowadays, some person think it is important to learn how cooked food and how it is composed. Other argue, that it is not as important as other subject. I think that to teach the science of food can help to save money and to avoid disease. On the other hand, it is important teach them climate change and other topic like biochemistery which are essential.
First of all, it is important to teach in our school how are composed food and how to cook them without spend a lot of money. On reason of that, is because we had spam of advertising around us and, if we did'nt have the good information, we could be more guillible and buy fast food. This misinformation could lead to waste money and poor choice for our health. For example, if you don't know where find carbohydrate, fiber and protein, you will choose the bad food and listen marketing.
In fact, nutrition is not the only subjet which is important, that our time is limited. Moreover, with global warming, our world could encounter a huge challenge during the next century. For instance, climate change and global warming are more important for their education rather than science of nutrition, because they need to be prepared to these big change.
In my point of view, it is important to teach nutrition to our children, because that could lead at an improvement of their health and lifestyle. In contrast, it is not the only issue in the world and they needed to know the fundamental knowledge about the world like chemistery, biology, physic to understand more advanced topics. For example, how can they understand why would needed protein if they didn't understand biochemistery.

When students know about nutrients and how to cook, it can help them make better choices for their health. For example, when I entered college, I saw many students who didn’t understand nutrition and often got sick from eating only fast food. On the other hand, some people say that there is not enough time in school to teach everything, so it is better to focus on key subjects like math, science, and literature, which are needed for good jobs in the future. They argue that the science of food can be learned at home or through other programs outside school. In my opinion, even if main school subjects are very important, it is still a good idea to include lessons about food and cooking, at least a little bit. Learning how to eat and cook well is a basic skill everyone needs in life, just like reading or math, so schools should make some time for this."

Some people think there is not so much to learn about food, but I think that is wrong. There are lots of different way of preparing food, and it takes lots of time to master them. Also, science behind food is very complex, but it is significant in our life. I will demonstrate my opinion in detail in this essay.
First of all, food is a critical part of a life. In many culture, having and preparing food is considered one of the most important activities to live a enjoyable life. By having a delicious food, one can feel happiness uncomparable to anything. Moreover, preparing food for someone like family or lover is a tremendously rewarding activity. By preparing food for them, you can show how much you care about them, and share your emotions with them. To enjoy this amazing part of life, it is very important to learn how to prepare food and what makes delicious food.
Secondly, It is crucial to know about how the food effect their health. Some people say 'A human body is a sum of what they have eaten in their life', because The food they ate become a part of their body in the end. We get most of nutritions we need from food. Thus, how we eat massively affect our health. It is scientifically proven that the food culture of a country significantly effect the health status of the people. Therfore, knowing about how the nutritions in food affect our body is very important to leave a healthy life.
For this reason, it is crucial to teach about food to students in schools. Food can be a means of communication sometimes, and it can be a precious present that is given to a life. Moreover, food is a source of energy that sustain us, and sometimes it is a medicine that cure our body. Hence, students should study about how to prepare a good food, and understand how it can affect us by its nutritions.",,,,,,6.5,"Some people argue that the science of food and cooking should be included in students’ educations, while others feel school time should only be used to study more traditional academic subjects. In my opinion, learning about food and how to prepare it is essential for students. Firstly, having knowledge about nutrition and how the body uses food is important for a healthy lifestyle. If children understand what different vitamins and nutrients do, they are more likely to make better eating choices as they become adults. For example, knowing what causes certain allergies or illnesses and how to prevent them through diet is a valuable skill. Secondly, learning to cook is a life skill that everyone will need at some point. Preparing food not only teaches responsibility, but it also encourages creativity and sharing with others. Some people say there isn’t enough time for these lessons because subjects like math and science are more important for future jobs, but I think health should come first. Without understanding food, students might succeed academically but fail to take care of themselves physically.

Modern society with the advertisement of fast food and new products rich in sugar is addressing children and teenagers to choose junk food over healthy. Thus, it is important for schools to introduce the science of food into their curriculum. This subject can positively influence the students’ choices about nutrition creating knowledge about food categories, compositions and nutritional values. For example, promoting a healthy and balanced diet can support the students to establish the mindset of acknowledging what they are introducing in their bodies and consequently finding specific foods that might positively impact their well-being.
Contrarily, there’s the belief that such a subject will reduce the time available for more didactical learning like math, geography or literacy. It might be true as not everyone could be interested in learning about food. However, if observing in detail the science of food, it is evident that it involves a series of challenging topics such as chemistry, biology, food engineering and microbiology.
To sum up, while some people think that introducing the science of food could be detrimental to students’ learning as it would reduce the time available for more didactical subjects, on the other hand, learning about food and its composition, can be beneficial as it provides with the knowledge that can support healthy eating and wellbeing.",,,,,,7.5,"Some people argue that students should study the science of food and meal preparation, while others believe that school time is better spent focusing on traditional academic subjects. On one hand, learning about food science and cooking equips students with practical life skills that support healthy eating and overall well-being. Knowledge of nutrition helps young people make informed choices, build good habits early, and potentially avoid health issues related to poor diets. For example, if students understand how to read food labels or cook balanced meals, they’re more likely to eat nutritious food rather than relying on unhealthy fast food. On the other hand, some people think that core subjects such as mathematics, sciences, and languages are more critical for future academic and job success and that adding food science to the curriculum will limit time devoted to these essential areas. While this is a valid concern, I believe that practical knowledge like food science plays an important role alongside academic subjects because it teaches valuable skills needed for everyday life. In my opinion, a balanced curriculum that includes both traditional disciplines and practical life skills will help students become more capable and healthy adults."

Both types of learning have advantages as well as drawbacks and this essay will highlight both sides of the situation.
The knowledge of food science is admired at some educational institutions where learners are expected to master this art. Students can gain numerous benefits by acquiring knowledge of food at the school level. For example, they become capable of making a career in the food industry or conducting further research on the science of food at the tertiary level. Therefore, some people prioritize gaining expertise in food science from schools.
However, some scholars support the concept of learning only essential subjects for academic and professional purposes. Firstly, it is wiser to learn academic courses that provide enormous career opportunities for the future. For instance, learning subjects such as science, business studies, and sports can open the door to chances for a student. Secondly, the majority of the prestigious jobs in the world are related to technology, economics, and communication. As a result, studying these courses at schools prepares a learner to gain expertise and thrive in the professional sector.
In my opinion, students studying at schools should use their valuable time for learning essential subjects as it helps them succeed in the future. Courses such as food science can be learned at a later stage of life. For example, adult learners are able to join an academic course on food science as many institutions provide face-to-face and online courses in this regard.

For example, students who learn to cook at school may be more self-sufficient and can contribute to their family's health. On the other hand, there are those who feel that school time should concentrate on core subjects such as mathematics, science, and literature, as these are often required for higher education and well-paying careers. They argue that a solid foundation in academic subjects is necessary for students to succeed in a competitive world, and that practical life skills like cooking can be learned at home or through extracurricular activities. In my opinion, while academic subjects are extremely important for a student’s future, incorporating some education about food and nutrition into the curriculum is beneficial.

However, not least have their opinion that students should spend more time on important subjects, particularly academic matters. I believe academic and non-academic subjects should be balanced, and this essay will explain both views.
Human brain development makes our kids learn many things in the early phase. Therefore, most elementary students have already learned math or non-native languages, which differs from the past 10 or 20 years ago. Also, they learn subjects unrelated to academics, for instance, science food and how to prepare it. These things are important to them, as they have the knowledge to choose healthy food and prepare it properly, cooked or uncooked. Another reason students should learn about this is that they currently love junk food the most for their daily meals, which is not a good fact for the next generation to have a long life.
Nevertheless, the knowledge of academic subjects should be learned in line with non-academic ones. The main reason is that it will be their foundation for a successful business or career. Without this knowledge, although they have an adequate understanding of the non-academic matter, they will find it hard to compete with other business competitors or candidates in any job recruitment. Eventually, with a long life and a good business or career, they will have a wealthy life ahead and, indeed, their life positively impacts others.

On the other hand, some argue that school should focus only on important academic subjects, such as math, science, and language, which are considered more valuable for future employment and intellectual development. These people worry that adding non-academic lessons to the curriculum could take time away from subjects that are necessary for passing exams and getting into good universities. In my opinion, both types of education are important for students’ development.

On the other hand, a group of individuals consider that cooking is a hobby and cooking classes must be optional to the student and not requiered for all students, to illustrate even more, a bigger portion of students may not be interested in cooking as others,whereas, schools must be used for more serious purposes ,for example, studying more complicated courses will have a positive effect on the students academic outcomes ,meanwhile, adding courses such as cooking might effect the students time manegement and influence their ability to focus on the important things,for further explaination, if they have a test or different assignments deadlines they should be really focusing on that rather than attending cooking classes.
In conclustion, and after analysis of both penomenon i presonally believe that cooking classes should not be considered as an essential course for students in educational institutions.",,,,,,5.5,"Some individuals believe that it is valuable for students to learn about food science and cooking skills as part of their school education, while others argue that school should focus strictly on academic subjects that are seen as more critical for future success. On one side, learning about nutrition and how to prepare meals could provide students with important life skills for healthy living, and help them become more independent and capable adults. For example, understanding what makes a balanced diet can prevent health problems later in life, and cooking can foster creativity and teamwork. However, some people believe that core subjects like mathematics, science, and languages deserve the most attention in school since they are fundamental for higher education and most careers, and time spent on cooking classes might distract from mastering these essential topics. Personally, I think that while academic learning is important, having basic knowledge about food and cooking should also be included, at least in a limited way, because it is directly useful for everyday life. In conclusion, balancing both perspectives, I believe schools should offer cooking and food science as optional or short-term courses, allowing students to benefit from both important academic and practical life skills."
415,2,"Some people think students should study the science of food and how to prepare it. Others think that school time should be used in learning important subjects. Discuss both views and give your opinion?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","With diet and nutrition becoming more and more popular nowadays, the food industry started to attract a significant number of people to join in, students included. While young people today are encouraged by many to pursue knowledge in related fields, some argue that school time should be invested in other important subjects. Personally, I strongly disagree with the latter.
The insignificance of food study is a misconception because of two major reasons. First of all, food is one of our most fundamental needs, but that doesn't make it less important than other fields. In fact, contrary to the common belief, it is actually a subject that still requires much research. For example, we are yet aware of the exact effects of different nutrtients and chemicals on our physiological process. Another problem is the belief that food is not as promising as other science subjects such as biology and physics. However, the statistics said otherwise. In the past decades, profits generated from food industry have been climbing steadily and already overtaken some of the traditional forms.
Pursuing a degree in food science is never a waste of time but its value has become more prominent in recent years. Not only can it help individuals learn more about the mechanism behind food, but it also enables them to lead a heathier life. In addition, as public awareness in health increases, people are paying more attention to what they put in their mouth, so much so that they are willing to pay for a professional to formulate their meal plan, which is a career with great potential for students interested in food research.
In conclusion, students should be encouraged to study the science and procedures of preparing food because it is a topic just as important as any other subjects.",,,,,,7.0,"The debate over whether students should study the science of food and cooking or focus solely on traditional subjects is a topic that divides educators and parents alike. Supporters of including food science in the curriculum argue that understanding where our food comes from and how to prepare it leads to healthier lifestyles and greater self-sufficiency. For example, many health problems stem from poor diet choices, which could be avoided if people knew more about nutrition and how to cook balanced meals. On the other hand, some believe that school hours are limited and should be used for core subjects like math, science, and language, which are essential for academic advancement and future careers. These subjects are often seen as having more direct impact on employment opportunities and intellectual development. In my opinion, learning about food science and preparation is equally important because it equips students with practical skills they will use throughout their lives, encourages them to make better health decisions, and can also inspire creativity and curiosity. Additionally, with increasing interest in sustainability and healthy living, knowledge of food is more relevant than ever. Therefore, I believe schools should strive for a balance, ensuring students are well-rounded and prepared both academically and personally."

However, dependence on computers in teaching may carry a certain degree of risk to students.Discuss both sides and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In this digital era, people always use the computer to assist their life, including education programs in school. It is so essential that most schools provide computers in the classrooms for their students. However, if the student is too dependent on computers, it will have two impacts, either drawbacks or benefits. In this essay, I will explain my opinion about both sides with relevant examples and experiences.
If we go back twenty years, only a few schools already have computers in their classrooms to support their education programs. Nevertheless, as technology never stops improving, thus the computer itself is getting cheaper every day. Hence, most schools can afford to provide computers in their classrooms now, and there will always be risks involved with that. In this case, a student who relies so much on computers may need more social skills, as the interaction between student and teacher will be less, that caused by the materials and exercises will be delivered online or by any application programs.
Despite the risks, there are also several benefits that students can gain from computers. First, it will provide much positive information or knowledge, not only related to Information Technology but also to other matters. For example, schools can provide an e-learning program for any subject, containing materials to be learned and exercises to be done anywhere and anytime. Besides that, a computer will assist the teacher when reviewing the student's homework.
In conclusion, the benefits of computer dependency in classrooms sometimes outweigh the drawbacks. Eventually, students can study more anywhere and anytime, although there will be a risk related to social concern.",,,,,,6.5,"Computers have become an indispensable part of people's daily lives, and their influence on education is undeniable. Many believe that placing computers in classrooms and incorporating educational software will enhance the learning experience for students. On one hand, computers can bring tremendous benefits to a classroom, such as offering access to vast online resources and interactive programs that can cater to different learning styles. For instance, students struggling with math can use specialized software to practice at their own pace, or access videos and tutorials anytime they need help. On the other hand, there is a valid concern that overreliance on computers could negatively affect students by reducing face-to-face communication and critical thinking skills. If students spend too much time on screens, they might miss out on developing their ability to work with others and express themselves without technology. In my experience, a balanced approach is best; while computers are valuable tools that make learning more flexible and interesting, it is important that teachers also encourage group discussions and hands-on activities so students develop a range of skills. Overall, computers should be used to support, not replace, traditional teaching methods in order to prepare students for a well-rounded future."

It is so essential that almost every student has already had it in their home or even on their hand. However, I believe that everything in this world has two impacts, either drawbacks or benefits. In this essay, I will explain my opinion about both sides with relevant examples and experiences.

Nevertheless, as technology never stops improving, thus the computer itself is getting cheaper every day. Hence, most schools can afford to provide computers in their classrooms now, and there always be risks to that. In this case, students may use computers for personal reasons unrelated to the lesson.

For example, schools can provide an e-learning program for any subject, containing materials to be learned in the classrooms and homework to be done by students. Furthermore, it will help not only students but also teachers when reviewing the students’ homework with computers.
After all, the benefits of computers in classrooms sometimes outweigh the drawbacks. However, schools must consider the mitigation of any unrelated use of computers if they want to provide computers in their classrooms.",,,,,,6.5,"It is clear that computers have become an essential component of everyday life, and their presence in classrooms is almost inevitable in this modern age. On one hand, introducing computers for teaching purposes allows students to access a vast array of resources and interactive programs, which could make learning more engaging and personalized. For instance, educational software can support students who learn at different paces and help teachers track their progress efficiently. However, relying too much on computers also comes with certain risks. Students may become distracted by games or social media, or they might rely too much on technology and lose basic skills such as handwriting or mental math. Moreover, not every student has equal access to computers at home, which could increase the gap between those with and without technological resources. In my view, while the advantages of bringing computers into classrooms are significant, schools should maintain a balance by guiding students on responsible use and ensuring technology enhances rather than replaces fundamental educational skills. This approach will help students benefit from modern advancements without overlooking important traditional learning methods."

What things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we he more auspicious of their benefits?
Computers are a relatively new invention. The first computers were built fifty years ago and it is only in the last thirty or so years that their influence has affected our everyday life. Personal computers were introduced as recently as the early eighties. In this short time they have made a tremendous impact on our lives. We are now so dependent on computers that it is hard to imagine what things would be like today without them. You have only got to go into a bank when their main computer is broken to appreciate the chaos that would occur if computers were suddenly removed world-wide.
In the future computers will be used to create bigger and even more sophisticated computers. The prospects for this are quite alarming. They will be so complex that no individual could hope to understand how they work. They will bring a lot of benefits but they will also increase the potential for unimaginable chaos. They will, for example, be able to fly planes and they will be able to co ordinate the movements of several planes in the vicinity of an airport. Providing all the computers are working correctly nothing can go wrong. If one small program fails disaster.
There is a certain inevitability that technology will progress and become increasingly complex. We should, however, ensure that we are still in a position where we are able to control technology. It will be all too easy to suddenly discover that technology is controlling us. By then it might be too late I believe that it is very important to be suspicious of the benefits that computers will bring and to make sure that we never become totally dependent on a completely technological world. As a result, the computers do give people all kind of convience including quickly knowledge and repeatable education. However, the dependence to the computers is really harmmful to both of students and teachers..",,,,,,6.5,"It is clear that computers have become an essential part of our daily lives, and it seems logical to introduce them into classrooms as valuable tools for direct teaching. On one hand, using computers and educational programs in schools can make learning more interactive and engaging for students who may struggle with traditional textbook-based methods. For example, in my own experience, using language learning software helped me improve my vocabulary and pronunciation quicker than regular lessons alone. Furthermore, computers give students instant access to a wealth of information and resources, which prepares them for a technology-driven future. However, there are also risks involved in depending too much on computers for teaching. If students rely entirely on digital resources, they might lose important skills such as handwriting, critical thinking, or even meaningful face-to-face communication. In addition, not all students have the same access to technology at home, which can lead to inequality and unfair advantages for some. Overall, while it is important to embrace the benefits that computers offer in education, I believe they should be integrated responsibly, complementing rather than replacing traditional teaching, so students can develop a balanced set of skills for the modern world."

Introducing computers and their programs in educational instuitions for learning purposes is a beneficial thing to students. The world is fast changing and students need to meet up and be at par with others in the world. The globe is becoming a more digital place and computers are the core of that, teaching using computers will open students' minds to new possibilitiies, faster approaches and more advanced ways of solving problems. A recent study showed that 75% of students who were taught using computers are currently more successful than others in their work places.
It is understandable that people also think that dependence on computers in teaching may be detrimental to students.

For example, educational software can make subjects like mathematics and science more interactive and fun, and students can easily research a topic in depth with just a few clicks. On the other hand, there are real concerns about students growing too reliant on computers, potentially weakening their problem-solving skills and limiting their ability to think critically without digital aid. Excess screen time can also strain their eyes and impact their health negatively, with students spending long hours in front of computers not just at home but now possibly at school as well. In my view, while computers should definitely be used in teaching because of the many opportunities they provide, their use should be balanced with traditional methods in education. By combining technology with conventional teaching, students can develop both digital competencies and foundational skills, benefiting fully from what each approach offers."

Furthermore, computers offer access to a vast array of resources and teaching tools, which can make lessons more engaging and help students grasp difficult concepts through simulations, videos, and interactive programs. However, it is important to consider the drawbacks as well, such as the possibility that students could depend on computers for answers and lose the ability to think critically or solve problems independently. Another risk is the potential for distraction, since computers can tempt students to browse the web or use social media during class.

427,2,"The dangers of smoking are well known, yet many people continue with this habit.What are the causes of this? How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Many people know the negative consequences of smoking. However, hey still continue this behavior. The main reason is that a cigarette has a chemical component which keeps people smoking and a vital solution to reduce smoking in public is to increase the cigarette price.
With regard to this issue, Nicotine is one of the chemicals that manufacturers use to produce a cigarette and its effect causes smokers to be addicted to the compound. As a result, even though these people understand the degree of this dangerous product, they are not likely to stop using it. Furthermore, many health organizations have announced research demonstrating that the factor that hugely affects smokers to not be able to resist smoking us not a cigarette, but Nicotine.
In order to counteract the situation, perhaps the most effective mitigation is for governments to set the minimum price of a cigarette on markets which is unaffordable for buyers. Consequently, this action possibly decreases the purchasing power of smokers and, subsequently, they tend to discontinue smoking. This is exemplified by the pilot project of Thai government which charge cigarette purchasers ten times higher than the market price in specific areas. After that the authorities conduct public surveys and find that more than 80% of people who used to smoke in the areas quit smoking.
In conclusion, people who smoke cannot change this habit due to Nicotine in a cigarette which can be addressed by governmental policy to raise the price of a cigarette with the view to promote citizens to cease smoking and take care of their health instead.",,,,,,7.0,"Although everyone is aware of how harmful smoking can be to one’s health, a large number of people still choose to smoke. This is mainly because cigarettes contain nicotine, which is highly addictive and causes people to crave more even when they wish to stop. Peer pressure and the influence of advertising also play significant roles, especially among teenagers who may see smoking as a way to fit in with friends or appear mature. To lessen smoking rates, governments can take several measures such as enforcing stricter bans on tobacco advertising and increasing health education about the long-term effects of smoking. Additionally, raising taxes on tobacco products can make them less affordable and therefore less attractive to consumers. For instance, in countries like Australia, where very high taxes are imposed on cigarettes, the number of smokers has decreased in recent years. Overall, while addiction and social factors lead many to continue smoking, stronger public health policies and education can significantly help reduce its prevalence in society."

While the others believe that smoking can distroy the body slowly and cause the early death. In this essay I will discuss both sides and I will draw my personal opinion.
In one hand , smokers are luch of awareness alternative of stress reduction. Thus most of the smoker believe that smoking is the best solution to releave the stress that they face in their daily lives. For example, nowadays we see many of employees are smoking during their working hours to beat the stress and headache. So that is why some people think that quit smoking is a negative point that can effect them directly .
On the other hand, majority of the smokers must have tried quitting smoking at least once in thier live time. Frankly it is extrmely hard to kick this habit. However, in the 90th some studies shows the facts that all of smokers can get the medical treatment for a while which can leave them to quit smoking forever. This prove clearly that smoking is just a habit.
In conclusion, after carefully analyis of the imprtant points, I believe that the government plays a signaficant factor to help the people, furthermore provide for them all options to stop smoking such as stop selling Nicotine which this is the main ingrediants to causes addiction and damage the body and the brain.",,,,,,5.5,"Despite the fact that the harmful effects of smoking are widely recognized, many people still continue with this dangerous habit. There are several reasons for this ongoing issue. Firstly, smoking is highly addictive due to the presence of nicotine, which makes it difficult for people to quit even when they know the risks. Additionally, some people smoke because they believe it helps them manage stress or feel more relaxed during tough times. Social influence is another factor, as young people often start smoking to fit in with their friends or to appear more grown-up. To tackle this problem, society can take several steps. For example, governments can implement higher taxes on cigarettes to make them more expensive and less tempting. Moreover, more public education campaigns can be introduced to explain the true dangers of smoking. Offering free support programs, such as counseling and helplines, can also help smokers who wish to quit. In my experience, schools that provide students with information about the risks of smoking can greatly reduce the number of young people who start. Overall, through education, regulation, and support, we can significantly decrease the number of smokers in society."

How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Although the health related issues caused by smoking are well known to society, smoking is still a popular habit amongst people. This essay will discuss the causes of the popularity of smoking and what can we do to reduce the number of smokers.
One of the main causes of people starting to smoke is the bad influence of others surrounding them. Most people start smoking at a young age, inspired by their peers or by people older than them already addicted to cigarettes. For example, research shows that nearly all questioned smokers started at a young age and, as they admit it, they started smoking so they can fit-in the surrounding social group. Furthermore, they say that they started smoking because they believed it looked “cool” and manly because their elders, like fathers, also did smoke.
Even though, in the end, everybody is responsible for the bad choices they make, but it is apparent that something has to be done to reduce the hold that smoking has over society. Awareness campaigns and an increase in the cigarettes cost are the two most efficient ways to prevent people from starting smoking. For example, for the past decade in my country, cigarette advertisements on television or in magazines have been replaced with smoking awareness advertisements showing the horrible diseases caused by this habit. Additionally, every year rise in the cost of cigarettes can be observed. As a result, according to research done recently, the overall number of smokers in our country has been reduced by 50%.
In conclusion, it can be said that most people start smoking at a young age when they are most vulnerable to develop bad habbits and that is why social awareness campaigns have to be done to prevent the young generation from getting addicted to cigarettes.",,,,,,7.0,"Despite the widespread knowledge about the dangers of smoking, many people persist with this habit, and several factors contribute to its continued prevalence. Peer pressure and curiosity are significant reasons why individuals, especially teenagers, start smoking, as they often want to fit in with their social circles or experiment with new experiences. In addition, some people believe that smoking helps relieve stress or anxiety, making it seem like an attractive way to cope with daily life challenges. Tobacco companies have historically marketed cigarettes in appealing ways, associating smoking with glamour or sophistication, which still subtly influences perceptions today. To reduce smoking rates in society, comprehensive measures are needed, such as implementing strict laws against advertising tobacco products, increasing taxes on cigarettes to make them less affordable, and promoting education campaigns in schools highlighting the severe health risks involved. For instance, after the introduction of graphic warning labels and higher prices on cigarette packs in some countries, there has been a noticeable decline in youth smoking rates. Ultimately, combining preventative education with legislative action can help discourage smoking and protect public health."

Even though we were taught that smoke is harmful, we see people exhaling this thick fog everyday partly because some people think that it is cool and it can be purchased almost at every store. This essay will discuss deeply about what causes people to smoke and how this issue can be alleviated.
Firstly, part of the society believes that it is trendy to smoke. In many pop culture, such as songs, movies, and novels portray smoking possitively. A comedy show that I have seen illustrates one of the character that smokes to be more cool, giving this character an untouchable aura, whilst other characters that did not smoke seem tangible and therefore mundane. Furthermore, cigarettes are easily accessable in any store. A recent study proved that over 80% of those eager to smoke for the first time actually started this behavior because they can buy it from their local shops. The trend from pop culture and the convenience in accessing smoke adds up to the reasons why some people continues with this habit.
I believe that there are solutions that can tackle and reduce smoking, beginning with medias should portray smoking to have consequences that are relatable. A movie I have seen showed the protagonist's constant need for cigarette throughout the show. However, in the end when he finally unites with his crush, he develops a severe disease, mainly from his smoking habits, in which he regretted in the end. This method of portraying people who smoke totally made my younger niece scared of smoking. In addition, government should control the accessibility of cigarettes. Policies that result and fewer stores being able to sell cigarettes and increasing tax pricing of smoke of any kind will definitely make smoking less convenient for many people.
In conclusion, although many people knew how harmful smoking is, many people think it is cool to smoke and it is convenient and easy to buy. By making smoking less trendy in society and harder to access, I believe that smoking will be less attractive, hence reducing the number of smokers in society.",,,,,,7.0,"Despite widespread awareness of the harmful effects of smoking, it is still a common habit in many places. There are several reasons why people continue to smoke, one being the strong influence of peer pressure, especially among teenagers who want to fit in with their friends. Additionally, some people use smoking as a way to cope with stress or emotional issues, thinking that cigarettes help them relax. Advertisements from the past have also contributed to the idea that smoking looks glamorous or rebellious. On top of these social factors, nicotine is highly addictive, making it very challenging for people to stop once they have started. To tackle the problem, society should focus on both education and regulation. Schools can provide more engaging lessons about the dangers of smoking that feel relevant to students’ lives, and governments can put stricter rules on where cigarettes are sold or how they are advertised. For instance, in my city, graphic warning labels on cigarette packs and higher taxes have discouraged many people, including my uncle, from buying cigarettes as often as before. In summary, while peer influence and stress can lead to smoking, effective education and stricter laws can help reduce this unhealthy habit in the community."

How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays, smoking has become very common in many individuals. Although governments have been trying to prevent people from smoking by displaying many warning advertisements on medias, people struggle to stop smoking. There many reasons that explain this, like the addiction of tabasco, the social effect of smoking, and the lack of awareness about the effects from people. However, many ways to reduce smoking on society exist like the promotion of physical activity as well as medical treaments.
Evidence strongly shows that the habit of smoking is triggered by the addictive side of tabasco. In fact, studies demonstrate that tabasco contain substances that affect areas in the brain which are reponsible of the feeling of pleasure and addiction. Thus, smoking becomes more and more pleasant and addictive. Moreover, smoking is a way of socialization for people. In fact, many individuals enjoy being gathered and discuss while they smoke a cigaret. They find it very relaxing and pleasant, so they do not plan to stop it as it allows them to meet new people for example. Nevertheless, I believe that the lack of awareness from people about the negative effects is a major component that explains why people do not want to stop smoking. Indeed, many surveys show that people do not know that smoking has several negative effetcs. They know about lungs cancer, despite it seems not to afraid them, but tooth and throat issues are less known in the vast majority of smokers.
However, many ways exist in order to encourage people to stop smoking. In my opinion, physical activity and medical treatments are the most effective. In fact, governments have been investing a lot in the promotion of physical activity by the means of advertising campaigns. For instance, in the USA, surveys show that there is an increase of 20% of people doing physical activity in order to overcome their addiction issues related to smoking. Moreover, medical treatments have been improved over the last years so as to help people to cope with their addiction with smoking, and studies show that treatments are becoming more and more effective. For instance, in France, the number of smokers has decreased, and medical treatment is the second reason to explain this phenomenon, behind physical activity.
To conclude, even though there are many reasons that explain the addictive behaviours of people to keep smoking, I believe that there are several ways to improve this situation, particularly by the means of physical activity and medical treatments.",,,,,,8.0,"Smoking remains a widespread issue, despite clear evidence about its health risks, due to a combination of addiction, social influences, and sometimes misinformation. One major cause is the addictive nature of nicotine, which leads smokers to rely on cigarettes for relief from stress or boredom, making it extremely difficult to quit, even when they understand the consequences. For many, smoking also provides a way to feel included in social situations, like taking smoke breaks with colleagues or gathering with friends. In addition, some people underestimate the severity of smoking’s health problems, especially younger individuals who may believe they will not suffer serious harm until much later. To address this, societies can take action through greater education about the harms of smoking, stricter regulations, and support for those trying to quit. Educational campaigns in schools can help young people understand the true dangers before they form a habit, while higher taxes on tobacco and bans on advertising can make smoking less accessible and less attractive. Furthermore, offering accessible support—like free quit programs, counseling, and nicotine replacement therapies—can provide smokers with the help they need. By combining these strategies, societies can significantly reduce smoking rates and encourage healthier lifestyles."

Many smokers cannot stop smoking because they are addicted to nicotine in the cigarettes they have smoked. Nicotine makes smokers feel relaxed and calm when they smoke and makes them addicted to smoke when they feel they need to relax themselves. For example, many people smoke when they feel stressed and when they smoke they feel more relaxed and get some new work ideas according to many smoking survey reports.
It is difficult for smokers to quit smoking, so it should be government responsibility to help them and make smoking situation in the country better. Government should launch a campaign that makes smoking habit be nasty and unpleasant for non-smokers in the country. If smoking habit is not acceptable in the society, smokers will not want to do so at least in public because they want to be accepted by their friends or people in the society. For example, in Thailand, government launches a smoking campaign saying that smokers smell bad and it makes smokers uncomfortable to smoke because they do not want to be smelly people and unfriended by people.
In conclusion, people continue to smoke because of nicotine addiction, and it is important for government to take serious action, such as releasing a changing-mindset campaign, to help society deal with this situation.",,,,,,6.5,"Although everyone knows that smoking is dangerous to one’s health, many people still choose to smoke for different reasons. One main reason is that once people start smoking, it becomes a regular habit because nicotine makes their bodies feel like they cannot stop. For instance, a lot of smokers say that they use cigarettes to feel less nervous or bored, and after a while, they feel they need to smoke to get through their day. Another cause is that smoking is seen as something cool or social, especially among young people who might see people around them or in movies smoking. To reduce smoking, the government and communities should educate people more about how bad smoking is and make it less attractive. For example, putting warning pictures on cigarette packs or banning smoking in public places can help people see that it is not normal or stylish to smoke. Also, programs that help people quit, such as free counseling or stop-smoking aids, can give support to those who want to stop but find it hard. In summary, the main causes of ongoing smoking are addiction and social influences, and to cut down on smoking, more education, restrictions, and support for quitting are necessary in society."

This is mainly due to the addictive nature of nicotine in cigarettes and the influence of social environments where smoking is considered normal by many peers or colleagues. For instance, in some workplaces or social gatherings, people often find themselves pressured to join others in smoking so they can feel a sense of belonging or relieve stress. To reduce the rate of smoking in society, governments and health organizations should implement stricter regulations and launch more powerful public awareness campaigns. Restrictions such as higher taxes on tobacco products and banning smoking in more public spaces can help make smoking less attractive. Another effective method could be to use media to constantly educate people about the serious diseases caused by smoking, such as cancer and heart problems, and also to show real-life stories of those who struggled to quit. For example, in Australia, plain cigarette packaging and graphic health warnings have contributed to a significant drop in smoking rates. In conclusion, the main causes of continuous smoking are addiction and social pressures, and by combining laws with educational efforts, we can encourage more people to quit and make society healthier."

How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Although it is well known that smoking causes severe damage to our bodies, many people cannot reduce the bad habit. This is a big problem because many people die of lung cancer every year, and social welfare expenditures are expensive. The point is why so many people continue to smoke and how we can let them stop smoking. In this essay, I will provide two reasons and related examples to solve the questions.
First of all, once people are addicted to smoking, they cannot stop smoking without help. In my experience, my father was a heavy smoker. He wanted to quit smoking but could not do that by himself. Thus, he went to a hospital and met a well-experienced counselor. After my father got advice and medicine, he could cut the bad habit. Therefore, a counselor's help is definitely necessary.
Secondly, cigarettes are still relatively cheap compared to alcohol. For instance, tobacco was very reasonable in Japan, my home country, several decades ago. Thus, so many people had the habit of smoking rather than drinking alcohol. Then the Japanese government raised the tax rate on cigarettes from 20 percent to 50 percent in order to strongly discourage people from smoking. Consequently, the smoking rate dropped dramatically. As Japan's case shows, the rise in the tax rate is quite effective in reducing smoking in a country.
There are probably many people who have different opinions and disagree with my way of thinking. However, considering the two specific reasons and related examples indicated above, I personally believe that addiction and low price are the two main factors of smoking and that the remedies for them are a counselor's advice and raise of tax.",,,,,,7.0,"Despite the widespread awareness that smoking poses significant health risks, countless individuals continue to smoke every day. One of the primary reasons for this persistent behavior is the addictive nature of nicotine, which makes it extremely difficult for smokers to quit once they have developed a habit. For example, I remember one of my uncles trying to quit several times, only to relapse due to withdrawal symptoms like irritability and strong cravings. Another important factor is that people are often influenced by their social environment; if their friends or colleagues smoke, they may feel pressure to join in, especially in social gatherings or work breaks. To address this problem, society can implement several measures. Providing easy access to programs that offer counseling and medical support can make it more likely for individuals to successfully quit smoking. In addition, increasing the price of cigarettes through higher taxes has been shown to deter especially young people from starting the habit in the first place. In my country, after the government raised tobacco taxes, I noticed fewer young people purchasing cigarettes at convenience stores. Ultimately, combining supportive resources with economic deterrents can significantly reduce smoking rates in society."

Although
there are many discussions around the world and some merits and demerits exists, I think that do homework is more important for children.
Initially, some people strongly argue that children should have other activities than homework. They will be able to spare time for exercise so that their body strength and immunity will be stronger. In addition, especially in Japan, some parents become aware of the Japanese educational system regarding English is not well organized. Therefore, some parents are eager to educate private English lessons for children as younger as possible after school.
On the other hand, children are struggling to catch up with their teacher's class
everyday. And they are required to learn several subjects in one day. Of course, children have a great ability to absorb a lot of memories like a sponge, but it must be hard for them to catch up with the school education curriculums because they need to learn several curriculums every weekday. Therefore, doing homework is a top priority for children to review what they learned every day. It is also effective for children by doing homework who are not so good at some subjects, like mathemathic, history, and so on. This is not only a great chance to enhance their good at subjects, and also helpful to overcome their difficult subjects. Otherwise, children will forget immediately and these weak subjects still remain as disliked subjects.
Finally, studying, including homework is boring. In contrast, it is the most important role for children to learn fundamental subjects as young as possible because some adults who did not do homework often regret they should have done when they were children. In addition, if children accumulate education by getting older, they will envision their dream what kind of occupation they would like to become.
homework is necessary for children more than anything.",,,,,,6.0,"There are many opinions about whether school children should have homework or not, and both sides have their own good reasons. Some people argue that children should not be given homework because they need time after school to relax, spend time with family, and do other activities like sports or music, which are also important for growth. For example, if children always have to do homework, they may get tired or stressed easily, and they will not have a chance to find out what they are good at outside of school subjects. However, others believe that homework is an important part of education because it helps students review what they learned in class and practice new skills on their own. Without homework, children might forget what they studied during the day, which can make it harder for them to catch up later. From my point of view, I think homework is useful as long as it is not too much. For instance, when I was in elementary school, doing math homework after class helped me understand the lesson better and remember how to solve problems. In conclusion, even though it is good for children to have free time after school, some homework is helpful for reviewing and practicing, so teachers should give homework in a balanced amount."

Many said ""yes"" and many said ""no"". Both sides have good and strong reasons, so let's compare them wisely.
On the ""homework is bad for students” side, most people argue that most homeworks is time consuming, and forces students to do it instead of spending their free time afterschool. This also keeps the students inside the house instead of letting them be active and explore the surroundings. Some even said doing homework gives tiredness, stress, and boredom, especially on exam seasons. It also slowed down the social skills development of active students. Many people agreed that homeworks and assignments should be given in another time, instead of after school time, so students could have time to rest at home.
On the other hand, ""homework is good for students'' side argued that most homeworks is designed to be done in around fifteen to thirty minutes (Or in other cases thirty minutes to an hour), and students still have time to rest and enjoy their life. Also, imagine if students don't have homework, instead of playing outside, they will rather watch televisions or play video games. In fact, doing homework sharpens your skills in what you practice, like mathematics or memorizing skills.
If students can manage their time, they won't feel stressed or tired. Because they didn't do it right away, and the homework stacked up, this made them not want to do it anymore. Or because they do their homework and do other things at the same time. They will get easily distracted, but if you do it focusly, everything will be good. Also you will be prepared for the next lesson.
So I agreed that homework is good for you, as long as it is optimized and isn't time consuming. If teachers are abusing it, then it will became a good way to torture students.",,,,,,6.0,"The debate about whether or not school children should be given homework has continued for many years, with both sides offering reasonable arguments. People who believe homework should not be assigned often feel that students spend a long day at school already and deserve time at home to relax, play, and develop interests outside of academics. They also worry that too much homework can cause stress and take away time from family or important social activities, which are also important for a child’s growth. On the other hand, those in favor of homework argue that it helps students practice and remember what they learn in class, especially in subjects like math and languages, and it teaches responsibility and time management. They say that a small amount of homework can make sure students are ready for the next day and understand the material better. In my opinion, homework should be given, but in moderation, so it supports learning without becoming a burden and still allows students to enjoy their childhood. For example, when I was younger, having short homework assignments each day helped me remember lessons, but when teachers gave too much, I felt overwhelmed and didn’t have time for my hobbies. If teachers can find a balance, homework can be a positive part of education."

In fact, they believe that homework is a crucial part for the pupil education.
Personally speaking, I am convinced that homework are positive tools for scholar to remember and pratice what they have learnt in class, but it should be a small ratio rather than what they are currently asking.
From my personal experience, I learnt that at the school age, children do not comprehend the importance of aknolwedge information in each different courses. As a result of it, pupil only focus on what they like, discarting subjects that are not in their taste and this is when homework plays a fundamental part. It helps scholar to fix in their memories the lesson they attended and from there building more ideas about it. Consequently, following the next courses will be easier for them. Not only does it help them to learn what has been thought, but also it gives them a method of study and habits which will be crucial for university or personal aknwoledgement. It set up the base to thrive on their own in the future.
Having said that, it is understandable if some people are against homework. Teachers might be given a heavy homework load to students, which is unfair because the children should also have the time to enjoy their childhood, playing and having fun. On the other hand, saying no to homework in their full is incorrect. If scholar are not having any homework, they will lose opportunity to learn and in the long run it will affect their productivities.
To conclude, I strongly believe that the benefits of homework outweigh the drawbacks. Therefore, homework should be given in order to allow student to understand how to flourish indipendently, but simultaneously, the amount of homework load should be re-evaluated.",,,,,,6.5,"There are differing opinions about whether school children should be assigned homework, with some saying it is unnecessary, while others argue it is essential for their development. Those against homework often believe that children already spend enough hours at school, and need more time to relax and explore activities they enjoy, such as sports or spending time with family. They worry too much homework may cause stress or take away from the joys of childhood. On the other hand, supporters of homework claim it helps students review lessons, practice new skills, and develop good study habits. From my experience, when I had a reasonable amount of homework, it helped me remember what I learned in class and improved my ability to organise my time. However, there were times when too much homework made it difficult to balance school with rest and hobbies. In my opinion, homework should not be completely avoided, but teachers should ensure the quantity is balanced and purposeful. When homework is thoughtfully given, it can help children understand their lessons more deeply and learn responsibility without overwhelming them."

The biggest discussion point is homework. Even though it sometimes can apply too much pressure on the students, it helps process the materials better and prepares students for adult life.
One of the main drawback of homework is the amount of time and effort it usually requiers. In a lot of schools homework takes at least several hours to do which can be a lot after a long school day. Another issue with homework are the mark that students get because the can affect a mental health of a developing child a lot.

It is also very common situation when a struggling student raised his marks by doing homework which improved his skills in a long run.

Traditionally, schools have used homeworks as a pivotal tool to support children´s education. However, in the past few years, some schools have piloted a homework-free approach. I believe that homework-based schools provide a more nurturing and effective education compared with homework-free schools.
Having homework most of the days helps children to develop their discipline. They might be interested in other activities like seeing friends or playing video games. However, children must learn to prioritize their homework over other activities, which promotes discipline. Similarly, if they want to do things different than their homework, children need to plan and adjust their time, thus learning valuable skills such as time-management. Both skills, discipline and time-management, will help children to perform better later in life. Additionally, it is reasonable to think that children who do their homework will be exposed to study topics for a longer period of time, thus deepening their learning experience. Therefore, they will be more knowledgeable in the future. Finally, one can expect that children who do their homework will be used to working for longer periods of time, which will be helpful during their transition to university and the working life.
On the other hand, homework-free schools also have advantages. These children will have more time at home to explore their own interests and hobbies. They could learn skills not typically taught at school like photography or singing. Since most children dislike homework, one could also hypothetize that children attending a homework-free school would be happier. Finally, one can expect that these children would be less stresssed.

Before we start discuss both these views. we have to know the meaning of the economic, you dear reader might know the general meaning but do you have any idea about what is the deep meaning of the economic. lets take a short tour.
When someone says ""economic"" he often means any thing realted to money, banks, industries, big companies, anything that making money its under economic, even when you are a tourist in somewhere in whole world you making the economic in the country that you live in for a few days go up.
Goverements argue that economic is very important than other for a list of reasons, lets know about some of them.
- They think if everything is related to economy then it most be more important than anything els.
- As the economy is almost ruling everything. so if they focous on the country's economy any other problem will be solved directly.
Now we know governments opinion, shall we beagan to look at the oposite view?
- People who take the other side, think that when the government works only on the economy, the education and the other important things will be going down.

On the other hand, some people believe that focusing only on economic growth can lead to problems such as environmental damage, inequality, or poor public services if areas like health, education or environmental protection are neglected. For example, a country might become wealthy but suffer from pollution or a lack of skilled workers if it ignores progress in these sectors.

The economy of a country is directly co-releated to its quality of life. Nonetheless, there are other goals, equally important, which are usually unattended. In this essay I will asses whether or not economic progress should be the most important goal of a government.
Firstly, money has huge importance due to the fact that it provides power. Furthermore, the most powerful countries are those who have more money. However, in the end, the value of a country is not measured by the amount of money it has, but by its education. A rich country is the one composed by educated people and that should be the main focus of a government. In fact, a country made of intelligent and resourceful people will somehow manage to increase its wealth, whereas if made of lazy people it will be doomed to poverty.
Secondly, everything related to money and consecuently, economic progress, is always linked to greed. Aditionally, a gorverment that suffers from greed makes wrong decisions consistently. For instance, my birth country; Spain. If you dig into the spanish history you will see a huge number of greedy and unethical decisions made in seek of economic progress such as the american conquest.
All things considered, economic progess is a vital goal but not the most important one. Goverments should focus on more valuable things like education. Moreover, decisions regarding economy should never guided by greed. From my point of view, governments shoud give economic progress less importance and attend other matters such as education or social aids. If they create a real change with their decisions, economic progress will eventually be achieved.",,,,,,7.0,"Many leaders today believe that boosting the economy should be a government's top priority because financial strength brings opportunities and stability to a nation. Indeed, when a country achieves economic growth, people often enjoy improved living standards, better jobs, and advanced infrastructure. However, some argue that focusing only on the economy neglects other vital aspects like healthcare, education, and environmental protection. These areas are equally important for a country’s development because a strong economy without healthy, educated citizens or a safe environment is unsustainable. For example, some wealthier nations still struggle with issues like high pollution or poor educational performance because the focus on money overshadowed other needs. In my opinion, while economic progress is fundamental, it should not be the sole ambition of a government. Balanced progress that includes social welfare and environmental sustainability creates a happier and more resilient society in the long run. Therefore, successful governments must pursue multiple forms of advancement, ensuring both prosperity and overall well-being for their citizens."

Governments that value economy over everything else tend to forget that the true value relies on the people and their needs, not in making money. Economy progress is part of a developed society but should not rely at the centre of issues because well being and good quality of life is a complex goal that requires success in many areas of society.",,,,,,7.0,"There are many opinions on the issue of whether a government should focus mainly on economic progress or give equal attention to other kinds of progress such as education, healthcare, and social equality. On one hand, supporters of economic growth argue that a strong economy provides more jobs, raises living standards, and allows governments to fund other vital services. For example, countries with a high GDP often have better roads, schools, and hospitals because they have the money to maintain them. However, others believe that economic progress alone cannot guarantee the well-being of a country's people. They point out that if a government neglects areas like health and education, citizens may experience low life satisfaction or struggle to find good opportunities, even if the economy is flourishing. In my own view, I agree that while a healthy economy is necessary, other forms of progress are equally important. True development comes when people feel safe, informed, and healthy, and when everyone has the chance to succeed, not just those who benefit from economic growth. Therefore, governments should ensure a balanced approach that combines economic ambitions with ongoing improvements in education, healthcare, and equality."

Some people,however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Since the industrial revolution, our economy has continued to expand and develop at an impressive increasing rate. Hence, many goverments worldwide believe that their primary objective is to focus on the development of goods and services. Others however argue that other sectors and their progress are of an equal value and thus similar effort should be made across the board. In this essay I will discuss why although focus on the economic progress can be benefical for a country, I believe that similar emphasis should be put into all sectors to greater our civilisation as a whole.
Firstly, It is an undisbutable fact that by govermental bodies contributing more so to the growth of industries, it provides for a better quality of life. More money being distributed to businesses and industries allows them to grow and expand, not only offering more employment oppurtunities but greater availabilty of services. For example, In Ireland during the 19th century era of the 'Celtic Tiger',the goverment supplied most of it's yearly budget towards economy. This in turn saw that the country saw an overall downfall of both the unemployment rate and in contrast the manufactoring and establishment of more and more bussiness across counties. This thus highlights how by contributing towards economy, it boosts living standards.
However, in order to contribute to a nations development, this can not be achieved by one sectors progress alone. It is believed by many that by putting emphasis into other fields, for instance education, transport and health, we can better a country as a whole. For example, Japan saw an increase in employment rates once the local government began to contribute more of it's spendings towards the expansion of third level instituitions. Having a better academic background encouraged more and more people to actually seek employnment from already established businesses, which they would not have ever dreamed of doing before holding a diploma. This in turn has had a rippling effect across generations as standards of living continues to surge. Additionally, by governements aiding in better health and transport availabilty, we evidentely aid to the better development of a nation. By having a means of travelling to and from work and similarly a means to take greater care of ourselves, we improve the quality of life of the people across that region.
To conclude, the economic growth process is one that continues to rise to date. Most governments believe that their key goal is the progress of this area. However, in my opinion, by equally aiding other sectors such as education, transport and health, we can further impact our economies growth and better the quality of lives for generations to come.",,,,,,5.5,"Many governments across the globe place economic progress at the forefront of their agendas, believing that strong financial growth translates into job creation, higher incomes, and improved infrastructure. For instance, countries like Singapore and China have prioritized economic development, resulting in rapid urbanization and increased standards of living for many citizens. Nonetheless, there are those who argue that advancements in fields such as education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability are just as crucial for a nation's well-being. If a country focuses only on its economy while neglecting public health or the quality of its education system, societal problems like inequality or poor health outcomes can persist or even worsen. For example, Sweden has invested heavily in healthcare and education, which has led to not only educated citizens but also a generally happier and healthier population. In my opinion, while economic prosperity is certainly important, it should not be achieved at the expense of other essential areas. A balanced approach that values social, educational, and environmental progress alongside economic goals will result in a stronger, more resilient society in the long term."

What solutions can you suggest?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"There is an ever-increasing number of bullying activities in numerous schools. Although it is widely believed that the potential cause is seeking social attention, it is unlikely to be true that school bullying is the appropriate method to build personal branding. Nevertheless, I firmly hold the opinion that every stakeholder shall uncover the most suitable solution to prevent those dreadful actions.
To begin with, the primary reason for school bullying is to express students' envy or frustration feelings. There is no denying that those students are bullied by their relatives, occasionally associated with the highest grades or prestigious achievements at school. Another essential consideration is the bullies occasionally have a lack of psychological well-being and look forward to damage other students' skills with dreadful aggression. This provides a typical illustration of the achievements that were achieved by my siblings.
Apart from this, some of the proper approaches could lend support to overcome bullying actions. It is often the case that dealing with oppressors is bitterly cumbersome, particularly for those students who are less capable of winning by standing up against bullies. However, I would like to reaffirm that they still have an opportunity to confront it, for instance, by documenting everything or finding someone in authority and explaining them thoroughly in order to take shelter.
In light of this evidence, it is crystal clear that school bullying is able to be eradicated with the presented techniques. Additionally, it might be better to leave the school and move into high-qualified schools rather than confront the bullies.",,,,,,6.5,"Bullying remains a major issue in educational settings around the world, and its roots can often be traced to multiple sources. One significant cause is the desire to fit in or gain dominance in social groups, which typically leads some students to pick on others who are perceived as different or weaker. Furthermore, it is also common for those who bully to have personal issues at home, such as experiencing neglect or harsh discipline, which can result in them expressing their anger toward classmates. For example, I have noticed that students who struggle with emotional problems tend to act out more aggressively. In terms of solutions, schools should prioritize fostering positive environments and providing access to counselors for both victims and perpetrators. Teachers must also be vigilant and trained to identify early warning signs, intervening appropriately before escalation occurs. Moreover, establishing clear anti-bullying policies and involving parents in discussions can ensure that everyone is working together to combat this problem. Thus, while bullying is indeed a complex problem, it is possible to significantly reduce its impact with a cooperative and proactive approach."

What solutions can you suggest?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays in many educational buildings bullying is became an enormous issue. From my point of view, the causes of this problematic way to act in a community are multiple. It might be due to family issue, bad example from the society, social media and so on. Despite the origine of this behaviour, it should not be tollerate, but punished.
To start with, bullying is a fundamental issue in the youngester society that needs to be tackled as soon as possibile in order to guarantee to the pupils a better childhood. One of the reason why a scholar acts in that way could be found in the household environment. If parents are violent with their child, it could potentially lead the student to act aggressively towards his/her fellows in order to release the anger accumulated at home. Another example that can provoke this type of behaviour is in the society idols. Promote bullying in series tv, movies or throught social media can misguide the idea of right and wrong in a pupil's mind.
Having said that, possible solutions to avoid children acting as bullys can be addressed. Firstly, in schools schould exist a zero tollerance policy towards this concept. Secondly, It should be put in place some code of conduct to direct scholars to understand which behaviour is accepted. Thirdly, they could be helped with counseling with a psycologist. Least but not last, bullying should be condemned. Educational institute might not erase this issue, but they can tackle it teaching good discipline and penalizing pupils who act badly.
To sum up, in order to address the right solutions, that can be different from one child to another, school schould understand the cause of bullying throughout counseling and then help the student out.",,,,,,6.5,"In today’s society, bullying continues to be a significant problem in schools, affecting students’ wellbeing and their ability to learn. The causes of bullying are often complex, but one major reason is a lack of understanding about diversity and empathy. When children grow up in environments where respect for differences is not taught, they may become intolerant toward others who seem different from themselves. In addition, the influence of social media and online platforms, which sometimes encourage harmful behavior or make it easy to bully anonymously, has played a role in increasing instances of bullying. Furthermore, some students might come from homes where aggressive behavior is considered normal, and they bring this attitude to school. In order to solve this problem, strict anti-bullying policies should be established in schools, with clear consequences for those who engage in such behavior. Regular workshops and meetings could also help educate students about kindness and respect. Moreover, providing counseling for both victims and bullies can address the root of the problem and promote a healthier school climate. For example, in my own school, peer-support programs were set up where older students helped younger ones, which created a positive environment and reduced bullying noticeably. Overall, a combination of education, clear rules, and support systems is essential to help prevent and address bullying in schools."

What solutions can you suggest?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Most children are facing one form of bullying or the other in our schools on daily basis world wide. It is becoming a serious problem and there is a need to solve this. In this essay, we would be considering two causes and possible ways to solve these.
First of all, the rate at which children bullying each other in the school environment is rising. One major cause is that bullying breeds bullying, children who are faced with physical, mental and emotional abuse from homes tend to transfer their fustrations on their peers. They think that is how one is supposed to live, exacting authority to gain superiority on weaker peers in school. Another is children who has low self esteem, such students feels threatened over their classmates they taught to be more intelligent or having better physical appearance than them.
Although, there are several causes of bullying, teachers should be taught how to identify children who are from abusive homes and inform the appropriate authority. These students would taken away from such toxic environment early and they would be sent for some pschological therapy. Meanwhile, education is also a key factor especially for children who have low self esteem. This should be done by forms such as role plays, presentation and drama, where these students are taught how to have self love and accepting what they can not change on their self.
In conclusion, children from abusive homes and those who have low self esteem are some of the reasons for bullying. I recommend that early identification of abusive children and education is some of the ways we can solve these problems.",,,,,,6.5,"Bullying has become a significant concern in schools around the world, affecting not just the victims, but the whole learning environment. One important cause of bullying is the lack of proper guidance and supervision at home, which leaves some students without the necessary moral values and empathy for others. For instance, children who witness aggression at home may come to believe that such behavior is acceptable everywhere. Another factor is the desire to fit in with certain peer groups. When students feel pressured to belong, they may join in bullying others so that they can be accepted by more dominant classmates. To address this problem, schools could organize regular workshops where students are taught about empathy and respect for diversity. Additionally, having counselors available for students to talk to about their feelings could help those who are at risk of becoming bullies or victims. For example, a friend of mine who was bullied in middle school found relief after speaking with a counselor, and eventually, the situation improved. In summary, bullying is often caused by problems at home and peer pressure, but with education and support systems in place, schools can reduce its occurrence and help everyone feel safer."

I think that now a days our society is experiencing a transformation of values and with these transformation a lot of thes important values are saturating to get forgotten.
I think that the first solution has to come from the house, with the parents. It's critical that parents are properly informed about these situation and have the correct preparation to Handel it.
Continuing with the idea of the first step has to come from house, the school were your child is attending they could give a seminary about bulling and the consequences. And inform parents that the school will have zero tolerance in this cases.
Also i think that you have to make aware your child about these situation and talk to them. Explain why its not good to bullying someone because there race, color or the way they think. Tell them that a show of maturity is to learn to respect the different thinking of people.
Like ones president Benito Juárez said ""The respect to the right of others is the peace"".
When i was at elementary these term wasn't around but it doesn't mean that bulling doesn't exist. In may days it was common that someone was bulling another student but the times it happened these students, stand for them selves so that's were it was over.
So also teach your child to learn to defend themselves and to no tolerate these type of behavior. Tache them that they will always can come to talk to you and help them solve these types of situations and also if they are wittnes of these type of behavior, to don't be indifferent and take a posture of defend the other child.
These could be by going with a authority ( teacher, principal, etc) or to try to stop it.",,,,,,5.0,"Bullying is a serious issue that affects many students in schools around the world. One main cause of bullying is a lack of understanding and respect for others' differences, such as their background, appearance, or opinions. Sometimes, students who bully others might be facing problems at home or feel insecure about themselves, so they try to feel stronger by hurting others. Another cause is peer pressure—kids might join in bullying just to fit in with a group. To solve this problem, I believe education is very important. Schools and parents need to work together to teach children about kindness and respect from a young age. For example, schools can organize workshops and discussions about the impact of bullying, and parents can encourage their kids to talk about their feelings at home. It’s also necessary for schools to have strict rules against bullying, and to let students know that there will be consequences for such behavior. When I was in school, my teachers always reminded us to be kind, and they created a safe place for students to report bullying, which really helped. In conclusion, teaching empathy, having clear rules, and giving support to both victims and bullies can help reduce bullying in schools and create a more positive environment for everyone."

From my point of view, they are doing this because of the benefits accrued from the importance of practising hobbies. For example, people who give time to their hobbies feel less stress from who do not. Another reason why practising hobbies a day in a week is vital for some people, because they want to change their daily routine of work and stressful life.
Hobbies have positive effects on a person. It is vital for his/her mental and pshycal health
by keeping their mind refreshed and maintaining balance of their well-being. For instance, doing a hobby like football or other kinetic hobbies has a significant impact on person's stamina. Furthermore, it is a good chance to move his muscle and prevent premature aging in many individuals.
The crucial influences of allocating time to hobbies that we can see on society are the importance of them in improving the family life which consquently will enhance the social life and the society. There are a lot of social hobbies like going to the cinema or travelling which a family can take a part in it and that will make an excellent environment between a father and his childreen and his wife as well.

One main reason is the increased pressure from work and studies, making people's schedules more packed and leaving little room for leisure activities. For example, many adults find themselves working longer hours or bringing work home, while students have to keep up with heavy homework loads and extracurricular demands. As a result, people often feel too tired or too busy to engage in their favorite pastimes. This decline in participation in hobbies can have negative effects on both individuals and society. Individually, not having a hobby to enjoy can lead to higher stress levels, reduced creativity, and even mental health issues such as anxiety or depression. On a broader scale, a society where people do not engage in hobbies may lose a sense of community, as hobbies often bring people together and help build social connections. For instance, group sports, book clubs, or crafting circles allow individuals to share experiences and support one another, making communities stronger. Without these opportunities, people may feel isolated, which can weaken social bonds and reduce overall happiness. In conclusion, the lack of time devoted to hobbies can be traced to modern life’s busy schedules, but this shift risks harming both personal well-being and the sense of community in society."

This essay will state some specific examples and analyze the consequences.
First, literature fans are declining sharply. Decades before, people willingly invested considerable time and energy on reading and studying Jean Austin and Charles Dickens. Literature clubs were appealing, constantly filled with true Shakespear lovers, among whom there were real experts. Unfortunately in recent time book stores do not favor the complete works of Dickens any more for it does not make much profit, and many literature clubs have their doors shut due to members have greatly decreased.
Also, it is obvious that sports have been losing popularity. For instace, even about 5 years ago, there were much devoted football fans, and almost every football club had a considerable number of faithful fans. People were more than happy to anticipate the match results and purchase match tickets and lotteries. However it is not the case any more. People are reluctant to stay in the stadium watching a 2-hour football match, which is proven by the constant nearly empty statiums.
These phenomena will bring several negative effects on both individuals and the society. First, many people will lose the ability of appreciating masterpieces of great authors like those listed above. Moreover, there would be fewer parents who like to buy their children novels of Austin or selective works of Shakespear, and thus among the next generation much more people may find ""Pride and Prejudice"" unfamiliar, and ""Romeo and Juliet"" alien to them.
People losing interest in sports can be a heavy blow to the economy. If fans do not watch the matches, some football clubs would be on the brink of bankcrupt. The government will also lose a great amount of tax derived from sports industry.
To sum up, we have to acknowledge that people tend to hate devote much time to hobbies, including literature and football. It will cause negative effects, like losing appreciating abilities, and causing problems to the economy.",,,,,,6.5,"Fewer people today seem to spend time on hobbies, and there are several reasons why this trend has emerged. One major cause is the growing pressure from work and school; many individuals now find themselves constantly busy with professional responsibilities or academic assignments, leaving little energy for personal interests. Another significant factor is the rise of digital entertainment, such as smartphones and streaming services, which can provide quick amusement but do not usually require the effort and engagement of traditional hobbies like painting or playing musical instruments. As a result, the decline in hobby participation can negatively impact both people and society. For individuals, not engaging in hobbies may reduce opportunities for relaxation and creativity, potentially leading to increased stress and less personal satisfaction. At the societal level, less involvement in shared activities like knitting groups or chess clubs can weaken community bonds and reduce the richness of cultural traditions. For instance, in my own experience, my local community center, which once hosted a variety of hobby-related workshops, now struggles with low attendance. Ultimately, while technology and modern demands have made life more fast-paced, the decline of hobbies removes valuable chances for personal growth and social connection."

With work and academic pressures at an all-time high, most individuals prioritize obligations over personal enjoyment. Additionally, the cost of living in many parts of the world has risen sharply, causing people to take on more jobs or overtime just to make ends meet, leaving little energy or disposable income for hobbies. Social expectations also play a part; there is a common belief that being busy is a sign of success, and people may feel guilty or unproductive if they set aside time for leisure. This trend impacts both individuals and society at large by reducing opportunities for relaxation and creativity. When people lack hobbies, they may experience increased stress, burnout, and even feelings of isolation, as hobbies often provide social connections. At the societal level, communities become less vibrant without widespread participation in cultural, artistic, or recreational activities, potentially leading to a loss of tradition and reduced overall well-being.

People try to cope with everything and do their best all the time but we do not have superpowers or an ability not to sleep 24 hours. Honestly, I firmly believe that it is closely linked to not having a hobby these days.
Needless to say, time spent on the leisure activities plunged compare to the last century. I firmly believe that one of the main reasons is an addiction to the usage of various technologies. The majority of teenagers cannot live a day without their phone. They try to hide from troubles in that unreal world of communication. I understand that a hobby can also be online, for instance, videogaming but, as I know, really few people perceive it that way. Honestly, the problem is not only in the modern decade, adults also often do not have a specific hobby. The reason of that can be only their overworking and willingness to achieve more than they have at the moment. This race to the best never ends and, sadly, affects others too. Children adopt the habits of their parents. It is a green light for young people to behave in the same way, to think only about work and do not spend any time outside.
On the other side, obesity, bad mental health and demotivation can be an effect caused by not having a passion for any activity. I have a great example of the topic - it is me. I had played football professionally for 5 years until I decided to quit the training because of a sense of disinterest in what I do with my life. After, although I started to feel worse and worse, I could not do anything else. I spend all day at the computer doing homework now. I firmly think that I am not the only person who cannot handle with feelings such as anxiety or sadness. Maybe it could be better if I had a stronger character but I guess that a large proportion of my peers think that they would never get enough of joy, therefore it is not only my problem.
To sum up, it is clearly understandable that internet and “tendency to be depressed” of present generation are rapidly displacing hobbies from human life. We need to think more about that problem because, in my opinion, we are really close to be as emotional and alive as robots.",,,,,,7.5,"Fewer and fewer people seem to be spending time on hobbies these days, and I think this is mainly because our lives have become much busier and more stressful than before. Most adults work long hours and then have family responsibilities at home, so they are often too tired or do not have enough free time to do something just for fun. For young people, school, homework, and part-time jobs often take up most of their schedule, and when they finally get some time off, they usually turn to social media or streaming videos instead of hobbies that require more effort. As a result, people may feel less satisfied with their lives and disconnected from themselves and others. For instance, when I was younger, I used to enjoy drawing, but now, after a long day of classes and work, I mostly scroll through my phone and rarely pick up a pencil. This affects not just individuals, but society as a whole: we miss out on creativity, skill development, and the chance to relax and recharge. Furthermore, when people neglect hobbies, it might lead to higher levels of anxiety and even health problems due to the lack of physical or creative outlets. In conclusion, I believe the loss of hobbies is a serious issue because it influences both personal happiness and the overall well-being of the community."

Others believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is undoubtedly the case that the world has become a global village nowadays. Cooperations between different countries exist almost on every occasion. As a result, there are inevitably large amounts of information that are exchanged and shared for various usages. However, access to information has remained to be one of the most debatable issues. Some people believe that information should be shared without restriction, while others insist that the foremost information shouldn’t be exchanged for free. In my view, appropriate measures or costs can be taken to protect valuable information from being abused or stolen.
It is fairly easy to understand the view of people who are in favor of exchanging information as much as possible. To improve the quality of research or guarantee the success of cooperation, it is usually necessary to share resources and exchange minds with each other. Furthermore, the amount of shared information is often decisive to the time and result, which sometimes might be eagerly expected. For example, it is almost unimaginable that the vaccine of covid 19 was so quickly created without intensive international cooperation, which contains an enormous sum of shared knowledge and experience in the diverse field, from governments to universities. With the benefit of this sharing, the period of the vaccine, which can take more than ten years in the past, was immensely shortened this time and the quality of the vaccine is also prestigious over the world.
Nevertheless, the over-sharing of information could also be harmful and risky. There is every possibility that information of importance and value can be misused and eventually leads to severe problems if the intention of usage can’t be proven as legal and righteous or the risk of information leakage exists through sharing. For example, if classified military information is hacked by terrorists while the governments of two countries are sharing and discussing their military intelligence, it will result in a horrible disaster that treats all the citizens. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to protect the safety of sensitive information from unauthorized access.
To sum up, sharing information is certainly helpful and meaningful in improving a wide variety of cooperation. However, it is also urgent to pay attention to the sharing of sensitive information in order to guarantee its safety.",,,,,,7.5,"The debate over whether information should be freely shared or kept restricted in fields like scientific research, business, and academia remains highly contentious. Proponents of unrestricted sharing argue that the free flow of information accelerates progress and innovation, as it allows more people to build upon existing knowledge and avoid duplicating efforts. For instance, in the field of medical research, open access to data and research findings can lead to faster breakthroughs in treatments and cures that benefit society as a whole. On the other hand, there are legitimate concerns that some types of information, particularly in business or when related to national security, are too valuable or sensitive to be shared indiscriminately. Companies investing large sums in research may need to protect their discoveries to secure a competitive edge and recover costs, while uncontrolled release of sensitive government information could potentially pose dangers to public safety. In my opinion, while sharing information is essential for progress, there should be reasonable boundaries to protect sensitive or proprietary knowledge. Finding a balance, such as sharing general knowledge but safeguarding critical or confidential details, can help ensure both advancement and security in these important domains."

However, opponents believe that some information holds too much value or risk to be made public. Proprietary business strategies, sensitive research on dangerous technologies, or academic findings that could be misused are examples where unrestricted sharing might cause harm or result in lost competitive advantage. In my opinion, while sharing information is crucial for progress, care must be taken to ensure it does not lead to negative consequences. Societies can benefit by encouraging openness but also putting regulations in place to protect truly sensitive data. This balance allows for innovation while reducing potential risks."

Is a huge town a problem to one's well being?
Firstly, its true that it could be a threat to human health. It is no secret that major towns have a many vehicles and industries; these raise the concerns of environmental and noise pollution.A dirty sorrounding can be a source of outbreaks like cholera as it has been seen in the past. Poor drainages in alleys being a breading ground for mosquitoes hence malaria.Noise on the other hand is irritating and uncomfortable. If anything, peace is a luxury in a town centre.
Traffic as a result of large population in these cities is quite distressing,so are the increased crime rates. Since many people move there in the quest for greener pastures, the number of unemployed, especially youths skyrockets.Muggings, buglary and traffic cause stress to residents . Stress has been said to lower immunity leaving people susceptible to diseases.
However, we cannot undermine the fact that big towns offer a lot of resources in terms of medical, gym and exercise facilities as well as professionals who are equipped with the know- how of health and wellness, and advantage to people who reside there.
In my opinion, one's health is almost solely their responsibility.You will decide where to live,what to eat amongst other factors that affect your mind, soul and body. One can beat traffic if they wake up earlier, they can also choose to go to the gym or not. Why do I say that? We have people in the less populated areas who are unwell or obese while we have those living in big towns and are in great physical and mental shape.",,,,,,6.0,"There are strong arguments on both sides concerning how much information should be shared in scientific research, business, and academia. On the one hand, many people argue that freely sharing information leads to faster progress and benefits everyone. For example, when scientists share research findings openly, it becomes possible for others to learn from previous work, avoid repeating the same mistakes, and build on each other’s discoveries, which can lead to scientific breakthroughs that may help solve global issues like climate change or disease. Likewise, open information in the academic world allows students and researchers anywhere to access valuable knowledge, which promotes equality and innovation. On the other hand, some believe it is important to control access to certain information, especially if it has commercial value or could be misused if in the wrong hands. For instance, a company might invest millions in developing a new technology, so sharing all their work freely could reduce their competitive advantage and discourage further investment. Furthermore, in some scientific fields, sensitive information like genetic data or details on dangerous substances might pose a security risk if made public. In my view, a balanced approach is best: information that could lead to significant societal benefits, such as health or environmental research, should be shared openly, while more sensitive or commercially valuable information can be protected in order to encourage further innovation and maintain safety. Ultimately, society should strive for openness, but with reasonable limits when warranted by public interest or security concerns."

Others reckon that such informations are too important or too valuable to be share for free. Here are discussions of the statements and my opinion.
By development of the technology, people can more likely to access to valuable information such as experimental results and interviewing results of citizens than before. Some people use it for their academic interests or for the business strategies, so that people believe that such information contribute to companies profits or individuals' advantages in academic. For example, many of the medical students read dissertation of diseases, which were written in the past. By reading and using the scientific information students will become excellent professionals.

What measures can be taken to protect them?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In recent years, the advancement of cutting-edge technology has been elevating the quality of life of customers worldwide. However, the issue at hand is, some consumers face difficulties in choosing products from companies because there are surging numbers of advertisements from rival companies. This essay will examine the extent to where customers are impacted by advertisements and suggest viable methods to protect customers.
To begin with, I think that customers are significantly influenced by advertisements viewed to the highest extent because their emotional decision-making as buyers are affected. Although some consumers believe that watching a Mcdonald advertisement on tv does not neccesarily encourage them to purchase foods from Mcdonalds, continously watching Mcdonald advetisements in a repetitive manner will subconsciously revert the customer's attention to order foods from Mcdonalds when they are hungry during late nights. In 2016, a study from Harvard University by Professor Oak mentioned that 75% of consumers who view the same imageries of advertising will began implementing it as a part of their lives. As a result, they become obese. Another point worth mentioning is, rival companies will tend to create an illusion of trust towards their products. If a loyal Colgate customer, a toothpaste brand, was convinced by Oral B through advertisements, another toothpaste brand that their product was better, they will potentially choose Oral B and rely on it permanently despite the fact that they have more flaws in their product. Hence, the customers will become emotionally manipulated.
On the contrary, there are a number of profound methodology to prevent increasing numbers of advertisements from influencing customers. One of the most notable ones is, the government should limit the number of advertisements published. Although an advertising company may lose attention from customers due to lack of the marketing, many customers will be able to focus on lesser advertisements that wastes significantly less of their time. Therefore, they will be able to enjoy more time watching the movie or series that they love. Moreover, another important solution that the government should investigate advertisement products displayed online. For instance, in some countries, baby milk powder was replaced with dangerous chemicals that resulted in food poisoning in babies. This caused severe trauma to consumers that re mianly family members worldwide. By implementing stricter control towards advertisement products, customers will be able to reap the rewards of the best products and move on with their life. Yales University states that by enhancing the quality of advertising campaigns despite the rivalry betweem companies, customers will be able to protect themselves from manipulation from marketing schemes. Therefore, customers will be safe from misleading products.
In conclusion, while I believe that consumers are significantly influenced by advertisements viewed to the highest extent and create an illusion of trust towards their products, there are also viable measures to protect customers such as the government limiting the number of advertisements shown and investigating advertisement products displayed online.",,,,,,8.0,"In today’s world, the bombardment of advertisements from an ever-growing number of competing companies has become a normal part of consumers’ daily experiences. People are greatly influenced by the constant exposure to persuasive messages, which often exploit psychological triggers such as fear of missing out, social proof, and emotional appeal. For instance, seeing frequent commercials for the latest smartphone can convince even a satisfied user to believe their own device is outdated and needs to be replaced, even if there is no practical need. Furthermore, advertisements often use clever tactics to make products seem more essential or trustworthy, which can manipulate consumers into making hasty decisions, sometimes to their detriment. According to a study conducted by the University of Oxford in 2018, over 70% of participants reported that repeated advertisements influenced their buying choices, showing how powerful these campaigns can be. To mitigate this, governments should implement regulations that limit the frequency and content of advertisements, especially those targeting vulnerable groups such as children. Additionally, consumers should be educated about advertising techniques so they can make more informed decisions instead of reacting impulsively. By combining strong regulatory measures with efforts to increase consumer awareness, society can create a fairer marketplace where people are better protected from aggressive marketing strategies."

I believe that this fact has certain negative effects on consumers' working performance as well as their private space and time. In order to protect consumers, some proposals related to protecting their information and eliminating the number of advertisements are required.
The increasing number of advertisements has a negative effect on the consumers. Firstly, their working perfomance can be reduced. Obivously, when a person is working, he cannot receive a large number of advertisements, process and response them. I know a researcher who receives a lot of advertising emails from certain banks
and even some scientific journal while he require time to perform many research projects. This makes him feel uncomfortable when working, thereby reducing the research's quality. Secondly, the advertisements can affect on people private space and time. For examle, when they spend time on their family after a hard working day, or even when they are sleeping. This completyly affects on the consumers, in terms of both physical and mental health.
For protecting consumers, certain methods need to be proposed. Firstly, it can be implied that the consumers' information is illegal used by many companies. Therefore, an imporvement of security method can allow us to protect consumers. Secondly, eliminating the number of advertisements performed by companies and eliminating the hours for companies send advertisements are required.
In conclusion, the increasing numbers of advertisements leads to certain unwanted results for consumers, such as reducing their working performance as well as their private space and time. For protecting consumers, we need to protect their personal information and eliminate the number of advertisements.",,,,,,7.0,"In recent years, people are increasingly exposed to a high volume of advertisements as companies compete for their attention. I believe these advertisements have a strong influence on consumers’ decisions and can even lead them to make unnecessary purchases. For example, many individuals, especially the younger generation, feel urged to buy new gadgets or fashionable clothes just because they see attractive ads online or on social media platforms. This constant bombardment of advertisements can encourage impulsive shopping and make it difficult for people to distinguish between what they truly need and what is simply being promoted by businesses. To protect consumers from such effects, certain actions should be taken. Firstly, it is important to introduce stricter regulations on companies regarding the amount and nature of advertisements they are allowed to send, especially through email and mobile applications. Secondly, educating consumers about the persuasive techniques used in adverts could help them make more informed decisions and avoid falling for manipulative marketing strategies. In summary, while advertisements are designed to encourage sales, they also greatly impact consumers and their choices, which is why implementing protections and increasing consumer awareness is essential."

Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Habits are taking significant part of human's life from the childhood, when parents are teaching to wake up and eat at the right time, and then continues to came with new people or new significant events. Some people are tend to always make changes in their lives, thinking it is a good thing. However, other people think in the opposite way, and prefer to spend their lives with the same everyday routine. The both opinions have a reasonable logic, and I will try to describe these perspectives.
On the one hand, avoiding changes make people's lives stable, and secure the comfort zone, which is not an easy thing to achieve. There are many books and training from psychologists and business coaches providing the phylosophy of doing the same things and keeping little traditions to structure the personality, focus on the right things, and have a plan for every day. Undoubtely, it helps to clear the mind, and keep yourself in safe in some ways from the rapidly changing life.
On the other hand, history proves that progress in development is caused by changes human activities. Of course, permanent changes in life means the lack of stability, nevertheless does it mean, that there is no progress?
The main point of this perspevtive is not to try everything that could effect positively or negatively, but to try to find a new aspects for personal grow, or get out form the comfort zone and chalenge yourself.
To sum up, the both opinions have their own benefits and drawbacks, but the strategy of changes in life dirictly depend on the type of people's character. People who have stable life as their prority are likely to avoide changes, and people who want to make the self-image and life better better will always in findings of new habits",,,,,,6.0,"When it comes to the topic of change in life, people tend to hold very different views, as some believe staying with routines and avoiding change leads to a more peaceful and secure lifestyle, while others are convinced that embracing change is necessary for growth and happiness. Those who prefer to do the same things every day often argue that familiar habits help them feel comfortable and prepared, which can reduce stress and make life more manageable. For example, someone with a steady job and regular schedule may feel less anxiety about the future. Meanwhile, people who support constant change think it is a way to learn new things and find opportunities that would otherwise be missed. They believe that by trying new activities or moving to different places, they can become more skilled and confident. From my own experience, I have learned that although a stable routine can bring peace, sometimes making changes, such as learning a new language or starting a new hobby, made my life more interesting and meaningful. In conclusion, while both approaches have advantages, I think a balance is best, since some changes are needed for personal development, but having a routine gives a necessary sense of security."

And others strongly argue that keep changing is more important to catch up with this society. Although some peoples opinion, working the same things feel relieved and stable in their life, I strongly recommend it is necessary to keep changing, and practicing to get along with this fast paced society.
It is often stated that some people are willing to work on monotonous tasks, and keep doing the same tasks is commendable, and be taken as the virtue, especially in Japan. For example, there are sophisticated handcrafts and the craftsmen are often valued and praised to some extent. Therefore, some jobs, including traditional crafts are necessary to maintain Japanese great culture.
On the other hand, technology has been developing in recent years. Robot and IT technology have drastically improved in a few decades. Surprisingly, some robots started to serve meals to customers' tables in some restaurants in Japan. This means that technology will take the place of many jobs which used to be handled by people. Therefore, people need to upskill in a variety of work for the future.
Finally, it is unpredictable which industries and jobs are no longer necessary by human work or other industries will appear in the future. The only thing people can do is observe and predict the social environment, and update their own skills. For example, if people perceived IT programming will be more demandable, and working the same tasks in the factory will be taken by a robot, they should start learning IT programming and other demandable skills as soon as possible.
In conclusion, people kept updating their own skills from ancient times. Therefore, people are required to change their lifestyles, and jobs to meet the rapid social improvements and changes. As a result, people will get used to this pace and be more creative.",,,,,,5.0,"There are individuals who feel most comfortable when their daily routines stay the same, believing that avoiding change brings stability and reassurance to their lives. For instance, many people in my hometown work in the same positions for decades, finding pride and peace in doing tasks they know well. Such consistency can also help people become experts in their fields, similar to a baker who spends years perfecting bread recipes. However, others argue that change is essential for personal growth and success in today’s quickly evolving world. With technology moving so fast, many traditional jobs are becoming outdated, and those who can adapt by learning new skills or trying new roles are more likely to thrive. For example, when my uncle’s business began losing customers because of online competition, he learned how to sell products on the internet and actually grew his company. In my opinion, while there is value in mastering a steady routine, embracing change prepares people to face unexpected challenges and opens up new opportunities, making it a more necessary approach in modern society."

They were doing almost the same routine every day, going to the same bookshop or gorceries on weekend and same things to do at work. There are not much changes in their lives. Others like to living in the changing environment. They keep trying new things, go to the different restrauants or meeting new friends. Sometimes they even challenging themselves by moving to other positions at work.
I agree with both views because these two views are not conflict. One can meeting new friends in the same coffee store or can meeting old friends in different coffee sotres. The change and unchange only represent some parts of their lives. Like the aforementioned example, one can go to the same gorcery shop every weekend but go out with different friends at Saturday night. Or one can go to different cafes but to have the same order of coffee.
The change and unchage are exist in each other. The world is changing all the time that no one can walking in the same street twice. This is a philosephy saying. Because as time flows the stree that you stepped on was no longer the same street, the leaves may change or the tree may changeBut if that is the same path you walk to company every day, it is the same street in your plan. That means the street is relatively changed/unchaged. On one can stop the world changing, and what can be unchange is ourself, or our minds.

They may find comfort and safety in repeating what is familiar because it helps them feel in control of their lives. On the other hand, there are people who believe change is important and like to try new experiences. They might explore new hobbies, travel to unknown places, or switch jobs to learn new skills. I think both ways of living have value, and it depends on the person and the situation. For example, my uncle prefers to eat the same breakfast every morning because it helps him start the day calmly, while my friend always searches for new cafes to visit because she enjoys new tastes and meeting different people. Even though I like my routines, I also think stepping out of my comfort zone can lead to personal growth. In daily life, there can be a balance; we can appreciate the stability of routines and also welcome change when the opportunity feels right. Therefore, I believe that both routines and change are necessary, and each person can find their own mix depending on what makes them happy and comfortable."

In this article I am going to demonstrate the reasons behind why people prefer to eliminate any chance to change.
To illustrate, I belive that there are too kinds of people, the kind which they prefer to change freqentily to try new things or to improve their life or to develop any shortage things they relies that they have to change. In the other side we have the people which feels more peaceful when they avoid any changes more then when they add any things new to there life. In addition, this group of people have another reasons that explain why they did not attind to change, the reasons about the space which they get from the stability, the new things make them feel more confuse.

They often believe that repeating the same tasks and habits makes them feel secure, and they avoid the stress and uncertainty that comes with trying new things. On the other hand, there are individuals who see change as a positive way to grow, learn, and improve themselves. They enjoy seeking out new experiences because they think it keeps life exciting and helps them become more skilled at adapting to different situations. For example, I once had a classmate who always volunteered for new projects at school, which made her very confident and open-minded over time. Personally, I think that change can be very valuable, even though it sometimes feels uncomfortable at first. In my view, those who are willing to try something new often discover strengths they did not know they had, while those who keep the same routine might miss out on important opportunities. In conclusion, while both ways of living have their benefits, I believe that embracing change brings more advantages in the long run, because it builds flexibility and courage."

On the other hand, others are convinced that change is essential for personal growth and happiness. They feel that trying new activities or altering their lifestyle can open up opportunities, lead to interesting experiences, and help them develop new skills. For example, when I decided to join a different sports team in high school, I was nervous at first, but I soon made new friends and became more confident. In my opinion, while routines can provide comfort, embracing change is usually more beneficial. Change keeps life exciting and allows people to overcome challenges and learn more about themselves.

Nowadays, living together before deciding to get married, is a common trend specially by young couples. I strongly agree that sharing a life before heading to the next level of a relationship, is a positive way to get to learn each other better.
First and foremost, by living together the couple will learn some of the bad habit the other one has such as brushing the teeth in the kitchen sink, leave the dishes in the sink for another time to clean them and more. It is important, that the person is aware of such behaviour, so when they get married, it is not a surprise. Additionally, the individual has enough time to deal with it or to make a negative decision. Moreover, they can talk about it and look together for solutions.
By living together the individuals share the bills and other invoices. Thus, they will find out if the other one is reliable and able to pay the bills on time. There is enough evidence, that the finances are a challenge in many relationships. You want to make sure that the bills are paid on time. In many relationships, the individuals share a bank account specifically to pay invoices, trust a priority, indeed. For example, you do not want to need to pay for your expenses and the bank account is emptied by your partner.
On the other hand, in many conservative cultures and societies, people can only move together after marriage. The individuals do not know whom they will be sharing their lives. Thus, much has to be learnt and accepted due to the fact, that getting divorced is not accepted.
To sum up, living together before getting married has a myriad of advantages. Thus, I am of the view, that it is beneficial to live together and get to learn each other well before taking the next step.",,,,,,7.0,"In recent years, the idea of cohabitation before marriage has become increasingly accepted, and I firmly believe it brings significant benefits for young people. When couples live together before making the lifelong commitment of marriage, they get the chance to truly understand each other’s personalities, habits, and routines. For instance, sharing a home will quickly reveal if someone leaves their laundry on the floor or prefers everything neat and tidy. Resolving these little differences while cohabiting can prevent future arguments. Moreover, managing household expenses together tests how couples handle their finances, which is frequently a major cause of marital problems. By facing financial responsibilities early, each person can assess whether their partner is responsible and trustworthy. Additionally, living together helps people communicate better and build stronger emotional bonds because they spend more time together every day. Although some people argue that cohabitation is not suitable based on cultural or religious beliefs, I think it is a pragmatic approach for most modern couples. To conclude, experience shows that cohabitation plays a valuable role in helping young people make informed and thoughtful decisions about marriage."

I tend to agree with such opinions, as I find the arguments that usually support them to be quite reasonable. For example, it is commonly said that people act differently when they are at home and when they are outside. People instinctively tend to be more relaxed and off-guard when at home, whereas in social situations they usually make an effort, even if unconsciously, to be more likable and to conceal the less agreeable aspects of their personality from others, even their partners. Because of this, it is usual to hear that one does not truly know someone until one has lived with that person.
In extreme cases, cohabitation before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail and will lead to unhappiness. Considering this possibility seems reasonable, as marriage is not only an emotional bond, but also a legal one, and undoing it is usually upsetting, time-consuming and costly.
Another reason I find cohabitation before marriage to be a sensible choice is that, as minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable during the first months of cohabitation, it is preferable to pass through that stage before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can already be stressful, such as the few weeks before the ceremony and the weeks following.
What I have said up to this point reflects my opinion, but it must be noted I did not put any of it into practice when I got married. Indeed, my wife and I decided to move in together only a few weeks before the ceremony. This decision was due to the fact that her family is quite old-fashioned, and moving in together before would undoubtedly have caused them pain, even if we had our reasons for doing so and they would have understood them. No degree of persuasion would have avoided or removed such pain. We found the long-term benefits of a stable and close relationship with her family to be more important than the discomfort of not moving in together, and we ultimately decided to do it only once the ceremony was planned.",,,,,,9.0,"There are many reasons to support the idea that young couples should live together before committing to marriage, and I am inclined to agree with this viewpoint. First, cohabitation allows partners to gain genuine insight into each other’s daily habits and personalities, which are often hidden during dates or shorter visits. Living together can reveal how individuals manage household responsibilities, finances, and personal space, and these factors can have a significant impact on long-term compatibility. For instance, a friend of mine moved in with her boyfriend after several years of dating, only to discover their differing attitudes towards cleanliness and shared expenses caused far more friction than she had anticipated. Had they married without cohabitating, I suspect these issues would have come as a far greater shock. Additionally, cohabitation provides a realistic setting to learn how to communicate and resolve conflicts, which is a crucial skill for any successful marriage. Adjusting to one another’s routines and preferences can sometimes be challenging, but overcoming these difficulties together before marriage can strengthen the relationship and build a solid foundation for the future. On a practical level, experiencing the realities of everyday life as a couple may prevent hasty marriages that are based more on romance than on real compatibility. While some people argue that cohabitation might undermine the traditional idea of marriage, I believe that understanding a partner’s true character beforehand can save both emotional distress and the painful process of divorce later on. Therefore, I think cohabiting before marriage is a wise and beneficial choice for young couples."

However, as our society keeps developing, more and more people start to accept the idea of cohabitation and put it into action. Admittedly, cohabitation can be advantageous. However, I do believe that people need to exercise caution when making the decision of living together with a partner.
It is true that living together with one's partner is a great opportunity for couples to know their partners as well as life after marriage better. Lovers tend to love each other so much that they can easily miss some tiny but crucial details or habits of their significant other. Cohabitation makes these details and habits unavoidable since two people are basically seeing each other for hours on a daily basis. Cohabitation can also be a buffer to help young couples move into a new stage in their lives. However, despite the fact that people are expected to completely understand their husband or wife-to-be as well as marriage itself, it is not guaranteed that they will still make the decision to marry that person after cohabitation.
Some people find it difficult or even dangerous to put the idea of cohabitation into implementation. Lovers in a long-distance relationship, for example, usually reside in different cities and can only see each other once in a while. In such situations, cohabitation means that one person must give up his or her career. This seems to be unfair and may lead to unnecessary breakups. Another instance is that some people can use cohabitation to, financially or sexually, take advantage of other people.
All in all, many advantages can be attributed to cohabitation, but I still think that people need to be cautious before moving in with a partner.",,,,,,7.5,"In recent years, the idea of cohabitation has gained significant popularity among young couples, with many believing that living together before marriage helps partners better understand each other. I tend to agree with this viewpoint to a certain extent, as there are clear benefits to experiencing daily life as a couple before making a lifelong commitment. When individuals cohabit, they are often exposed to their partner’s habits, schedules, and attitudes in a way that dating alone does not reveal. This exposure can make it easier to recognize potential sources of conflict or incompatibility that might otherwise remain hidden until after marriage. For example, a friend of mine realized her partner’s untidiness became a serious issue only when they started living together, giving her a chance to address this concern before any wedding plans were made. Despite these advantages, cohabitation is not a guarantee of a successful marriage, as some couples discover new challenges and ultimately choose to separate. Moreover, in certain cultures or families, cohabitation without marriage can cause social or emotional difficulties. Overall, while cohabitation can help young couples learn more about each other and make more informed decisions, it should be approached thoughtfully, considering both personal values and circumstances."
519,2,Write about the following topic.Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child's development while others think that it is important for children to go to school.Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Accurately assessing which is the best way of teaching children is not an easy task, but when it comes to comparing between taking lesson at home or at school the issue becomes even more complicated to figure it out. In this essay I am going to explain the two main views people hold on this subject.
A sizeable number of people argue that children would be best served by being taught at home rather than turning up at school , because of the highly comfortable and utterly familiar environment, which allow them to being involved into attending lessons as well as doing assignments more effectively and reducing distractions. As a result , thanks to the time-saving, the children may have enough time to spent for their leisure and sport activities.
However, many others beg to differ, claiming that a laptop cannot replace human touch without impacts negatively students performances, since the lack of direct relationship in that specific stage of age might be detrimental not only to children’s school marks, but for themselves.
Moreover, those who hold this current of thought contend that being a student-at-home come at the cost of concentration, as such a comforting background may shift children focus toward more appealing activities, standing in stark contrast with the former view aforementioned.
To my mind, I believe that COVID experience has provided some insight that could help us to take the stock of the situation in this vein, namely, the flurry of psychological ailments of which the children were suffering during the lockdown were mostly sparked by their isolation toward their peers, it found.
Consequently, it means that relationship restriction would lead to depression which in turn, affects the mental processes underlying the school performances overall. Hence, it is reasonable to think that children are better off studying at school along with their mates rather than in a more reclusive way such as doing it alone at home.",,,,,,7.0,"Deciding whether children should be taught at home or in school remains a challenging topic, as both methods have notable advantages worth considering. On one hand, supporters of homeschooling often highlight the benefits of a personalized learning environment, where parents can tailor lessons to each child’s unique pace and interests, potentially leading to better academic outcomes and less stress. For instance, a child struggling with mathematics can spend extra time on that subject without feeling left behind, which can boost confidence and motivation. Moreover, learning at home allows for a flexible schedule, giving children more opportunities to pursue hobbies and family time. On the other hand, attending school offers significant social advantages, as children interact with peers from diverse backgrounds, learning crucial communication and teamwork skills that are essential for adulthood. Additionally, schools provide access to professional teachers and various resources, such as science labs, sports facilities, and clubs, which are difficult to replicate at home. Personally, I believe that while homeschooling can be effective for certain families, traditional schools better support a child’s overall growth by promoting both academic and social development. My own experience attending public school showed me the importance of friendships and extracurricular activities in shaping my identity and preparing me for real-world challenges, which is something I fear many homeschooled children might miss out on. Therefore, despite the merits of home-based education, I think that going to school presents a more balanced environment for a child’s development in today’s society."

For the reason that kids are the future. Some people prefer their kids to get home-educated, while others believe that it is important for them to go to school. I am a strong advocate that children must go to school for a variety of reasons, wich will be mentioned in this essay.
To commence with, eventhough it is important to get a proper education and this can be found in both schools and at home, however, going to school on a daily basis can garantee the kid to communicate with his/her peers. And this can be in a negative or positive way- nowadays, but no matter which way the kid experiences, it is still going to be an experience that the kid will develop and learn from after. And it will assist bulding the child's character, in addition to, other fundemental traits. Like for example, gaining self-esteem, and leading skills, and so on ...
Likewise, it is children nature to be too energetic- generally speaking- so going to school, and playing with their friends, can be the best way for them to get rid of this energy. For instance, if the kid was running around the house, he propably would get scolded by his parents. Because at home there is no much space like outside. In addition, it is for the child's physical health to be active and go outside, not stay at home all day.
Overall, I believe that it is a better option for them to go to school instead of getting home-schooled. As well as, communication and playing with other children which can be a proper way for them to get developed mentally and pysically.",,,,,,5.5,"There are different opinions about whether children should learn at home or in school. Some people think homeschooling is best because it lets parents focus on what their child really needs, and the learning can go at the speed that suits the child. Parents can also make sure their children are safe and learn family values at home. However, other people say that going to school is better for children’s development. At school, kids meet lots of other students, so they can make friends, learn to share, and work as a team. For example, students often work together in groups or join sports clubs, which helps them develop important life skills. In my opinion, children should go to school because they not only get taught subjects by professional teachers but also have a chance to learn how to deal with all kinds of people and situations. Even though learning at home may be good for some families, going to school is more helpful for children’s social and personal growth, which will help them in the future."

Although teaching at home sometimes provided a more comfortable environment, I believe that making children go to school is better for their development.
On the one hand, studying at home always provides a comfortable environment for children. When children study at some place they live and stay every day, they tend to be more relaxed, it can encourage children to study in better efficiency. In addition, education plans can be customized if children are going to study at home, and maximize their advantages in talents. Take the case of Lang Lang, who was a famous Chinese musician, he was found talented in piano since he was the age of 5 and started long-term customized piano training at home, eventually becoming the champion of the Chinese national piano competition in his 20s. Furthermore, parents can take care of children’s study progression, difficulties, and mental health the first time, and make corresponding adjustments in time.
On the other hand, it perhaps better for children’s development to let them get used to go to school. Firstly, despite the comfortable, simple environment at home, children could not always stay inside their “green house” once they grew up, they need to develop the ability to be compatible with the pressures that come from a more complex social environment, while school can be their first step to practicing such ability. Secondly, it is necessary for children to learn and apply team collaboration skills in order to overcome some difficulties that could not be solved by a single person. Finally, school is the first platform that enables children to develop their own networking, which is a kind of wealth that can help their personal development in the future. For example, many typical famous people like Napoleon Bonaparte, and Winston Churchill all started to develop strong social networking since they were in school, and the networking provided them with vital help on their path to success.
In conclusion, I can understand why people might want children to be taught at home, but I strongly hold the opinion that it’s better for children’s development to send them to school.",,,,,,8.0,"While some people argue that home education is the most beneficial approach for children's development, others contend that traditional schooling plays a more crucial role. There are clear advantages to teaching children at home, such as the ability to personalize the curriculum and go at the child's own pace, which can help students focus on subjects where they need more help or wish to excel. For instance, a child who has difficulty with math but excels in languages might receive more tailored support and encouragement at home, leading to better academic results. Additionally, homeschooling often provides a less stressful environment, free from distractions or negative influences that may be present in schools. However, attending school also offers significant benefits. It exposes children to a diverse group of peers, helping them develop social skills, learn how to cooperate with others, and build friendships that can last a lifetime. Going to school also prepares children for working in teams and resolving conflicts, skills that are important in adult life. For example, group projects in school teach students to share ideas and accept different points of view. In my opinion, while home education can be suitable in certain special situations, school attendance is generally more beneficial for a child's development because it encourages social growth and provides broader learning experiences."

While teaching children at home might be useful for getting better score and children be more included, I personally am of the opinion that school based education is far outweigh in areas like socializing and it's more important for the future life.
It is often said that when childrens studying at home is better for their development. When student has no distractions such as classmates and school drama and sometimes bullying they are more involved and motivated to study and get good assignments. Moreover, they have less stress comparing themselves to others. For example, during the pandemic of Covid-19 students all over the world were transeffered for home education and this process brought big educational success to all of them. Overall, home base education has one very big benefit among all others, it is the posibility for student to be more focused on education without any distractions.
However, education at school has their pros too and most important of them is socializing. For every person is very important to know how to work, deal and socialize with other people and it's very good when someone can learn it in the school rather than in adult life. For instance, University of Latvia in their research in 2008 proved that students who studied at school are more socialized and are bigger part of the community in their adult life than students came from home based education. In conclusion, school based education is good for styding not only school programm, but also real life.
From my perspective, socializing skills outweight the educational success as it's more important for an adults life.
To conclude, both methods of education either home based or school based have their benefits. Every person should decide for themselves what is better for them or their childrens.",,,,,,7.0,"Some individuals argue that learning at home provides the most suitable environment for a child’s growth, while others claim that attending school is crucial for children’s development. On the one hand, home education allows for personalized attention and a flexible pace, so children can focus on their strengths and address weaknesses more efficiently. For example, families who homeschool can adjust their lessons if a student is struggling with a subject, and parents can give more support. In addition, some children feel more comfortable and less anxious at home, away from potential problems in schools such as bullying or peer pressure. On the other hand, going to school offers important opportunities to develop social and teamwork skills which are difficult to gain in isolation. School provides a structured routine, teaches children how to communicate with different people, and prepares them for the challenges of adult life. For instance, working on group assignments in the classroom helps children learn to cooperate and problem-solve with others. In my opinion, although home education can lead to strong academic results for some, the valuable life skills and interactions found in traditional schools are essential for a balanced development. Therefore, I believe school education is generally more important, but families should choose what suits their child's needs best."

Some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage. Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Recently, many countries have legalized gay marriage. However, there are many people who do not agree with that, and claim that it has a bad influence on the education of children, and the evolution of society. However, in my opinion, I think it is a good opportunity for homosexual people as they are now understood by others, and have the right to have children despite of their situation.
To begin, there are many parents, for example, who tend to believe that because of the access to gay marriage, their children will find it normal to fall in love with a person from the same sex. As a result, more and more children will become homosexual, which is unconventional as far as the parents are concerned. However, I believe that it is not because children understand the fact that being gay is normal, that they will be influenced by this. In fact, they will be able to compassionate for people who struggle to express their homosexuality, so they will help them to feel more comfortable with that. Moreover, they will be more open-minded which is very important for children development.
Secondly, many other people are convinced that gay marriage will inevitably tends towards a decrease of the young population as gay individuals can not have their own kids. As a consequence, This phenomenon represents a threat because young people will not be able to take over for the future. However, I am not of this opinion. I think that such a decrease in young people population will not occur as the vast majority of the world's population in not homosexual. Moreover, by allowing gay marriage, gay couples will be able to adopt children. Indeed, due to the fact that they are not able to give rise to new-born, they can adopt children who are abandonned, and give them the opportunity to live in a new family with good conditions.
To conclude, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a good opportunity for the development of the society. Indeed, not only it makes children more open-minded, which is important for their own development, but also gives for those who are unfortunately abandonned, a safe environment to thrive in.",,,,,,8.0,"The subject of gay marriage continues to create disagreement among various groups in society. Some people argue that allowing gay marriage could weaken traditional values and negatively impact how children view family, while others see it as a basic human right that recognizes the equality of all individuals. Personally, I believe gay marriage should be legal because everyone deserves the opportunity to love and marry whomever they choose. Many people are concerned that the legalization of gay marriage will confuse young people or lead to changes in the traditional family structure, but I think that children benefit from seeing a variety of loving relationships. For instance, in my neighborhood, two women who are married take care of two adopted children, and those children appear just as happy and healthy as those raised by heterosexual couples. In addition, legalizing gay marriage can help reduce discrimination by making it clear that all couples have equal rights, which could lead to greater acceptance over time. Studies from countries where gay marriage is legal, such as Canada, have shown that there is no negative effect on society or population growth. In conclusion, I strongly believe gay marriage should be accepted, as it promotes fairness and allows more people to create families based on genuine love and commitment."

Many countries in Europe or Asia supported the legal marriage in LGBTQs, howere in some religious culture, the topic are very sensitive to be discussion and in worsely the LGBTQs were banned.
Love and being in the relationships depend on people' s mutual feeling. There is no boundaries of love, even they have same gender or different races, or even speak the different languages. Therefore, if they decided to settle down and live the rest of their lives together, the social determinants will be no longer to influence the relationship.
It is acceptable for the caring and understanding to maintain their marriage lives. As long as they could stay together and share thick or thin time together. The couple could have the good qualities of lives, some developed countries supported and launched legal LGBTQs marriage.
In conclusion, I strongly agree with legal LQBTQs marriage, so far they could share the moment together , they could extend their life expectancy and they could build the everlasting love until the last days of their lives. To love is to cherish their moments together.",,,,,,4.5,"The debate over gay marriage continues to be a significant topic in many countries, with people expressing strong opinions on both sides. Some individuals argue that legalizing gay marriage could harm traditional values or create challenges for society, especially in cultures that hold conservative beliefs. However, others believe that everyone deserves the right to choose their life partner regardless of gender, and that love between two consenting adults should be respected. In my view, gay marriage should be legal because it supports equality and human rights. For example, in countries where same-sex marriage is allowed, such as Canada and Spain, LGBTQ people are able to live openly without fear of legal discrimination, and research shows societies often become more inclusive after legalization. Additionally, denying some people the right to marry causes unnecessary pain and inequality, which does not benefit society as a whole. Therefore, allowing gay marriage gives everyone the opportunity to experience love and marriage equally, promoting a sense of acceptance and happiness among all members of the community."

In modern society, increased visibility and acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals have shown that allowing same-sex couples to marry does not weaken social stability or family values; rather, it encourages inclusivity, happiness, and fairness. Personally, I believe that gay marriage should be legal because every individual deserves the freedom to love and form a family with the person they choose.

Many people view it as a legal right for individulas to marry whatever person, regardless of gender, they consider as a suitable partner. Others, however, believe that gay marriage should be illegal, as it spreads the notion that being gay is normal.
Certainly, both paries make some sound arguments supporing their views, and it is not effortless to decide which side to pick. Nevertheless, governments should not be basid towards any party's views, and a decision from the government must be based on the values and principles of its nation.
People supporing gay marriage claim that governments and individuals should not have the right to decide for people who to marry, as it damages the well-being of those individulals. Moreover, they argue that gayness is not a new tread that has just given a birth, but a natural behavior that has been existed among some types of animals for centuries.
People opposing gay marriage, however, claim that such a behavior will destory society as gay partners cannot reproduce, and thus, the population number will start gradually decrease. Opposiers also ague that if gay marriage was a natural behavior, religion would have advised to do it rather than giving severe warning for people who practice such behavior.

On the other hand, opponents sometimes point to cultural and religious beliefs, suggesting that governments have a responsibility to preserve traditional values.

541,2,Write about the following topic.Some people think that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Some people strongly blame that the government does not control the rise in obesity in children. Although the government needs to take responsibility to some extent, I disagree with this idea.
Firstly, people need to consider, who needs to take responsibility for raising children. It is obviously their parents. This means that if parents gave well controlled, and balanced nutritious food to children, it would be possible to prevent the rise in obesity. Therefore, parents need to consider their children's health as a top priority, instead of criticizing the government. Therefore, parents first need to master cooking.
On the other hand, some countries face a high percentage of obesity in children is higher than in other developed countries. This means that some food that contains too much sugar might be sold cheaper than healthy food, vegetable, chicken, fish, and so on. Therefore, parents who are suffering from poverty tend to choose cheaper, and unhealthy food. This is understandable that governments need to control the prices between healthy food and too much sugar and fat contained food.
Finally, in my opinion, however, some food contains too much sugar, fat, and too high calories are cheaper, so parents need to consider their children's health as the first priority. Although the government controlled the food prices between unhealthy food and wholesome food, the parents continued choosing unhealthy food and never cooked meals, and the rise in obesity in children remains the same. Therefore, the most important point is parents need to educate themselves about nutrition and observe their children's diet. If they learned and made some effort to provide healthy food to children, the percentage of obesity will drastically drop.",,,,,,6.0,"Some people believe that the government must take full responsibility for the increase in childhood obesity, but I do not agree with this idea entirely. While it is true that governments have a role to play in promoting healthy lifestyles, it is ultimately the parents who have the most influence over their children's diet and habits. For example, parents are the ones who decide what kind of food is served at home and how much exercise their children do. If parents provide regular homemade meals with fruits and vegetables and limit sugary snacks, their children are less likely to become overweight. However, I also recognize that in some areas, unhealthy food is cheaper and more easily available than healthy food, often due to government policies or lack of regulation. In such cases, the government can help by making healthy food more affordable and by running public campaigns to teach families about nutrition. In conclusion, although the government can help create a healthy environment, I think parents must take the main responsibility for their children's weight by making wise choices for their everyday meals and activities."

While both have effects on the childs habits from an early age, i think that it is mostly the parents fault.
It is debated that childhood obesity is mainly the parents responsibility for various reasons. Many parents schedueles and lifestyles are not fit for having a child as their routines are not flexible enough to properly take care of him/her. For example, in most western houses, both the mother and the father have jobs to attend everyday, and dont return home to their children till the late afternoon. By that time, the parents will both be too exausted to properly look after their child, which will lead to him/her eating any food no matter its quality and source such as fast foods and sweets, which are calorie dense and low volume. Furthermore, studies have shown that around 42 percent of parents in the United States did not care what their child consumed given it was cheap and does not require preparation. As far as i am concerned, this is enough evidence to justify it being mostly the parents fault.
On the other hand, others argue that it is primarely the governments fault. Governments have complete control over what advertisements can or cannot be portrayed to the public. Knowing that most advertisements we see are related to fast food chains and chocolate bars, we can deduce that it undoubtebly has a major effect on children which will beg their parents. to try some of this food. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that fast foods contain substances which encourage addiction. So when fast foods are easily accesible no matter which city you are in, parents will have a hard time controlling which foods their children eat. I agree that the government has a major influence on children, but their parents have greater controll over them.
In conclusion, while the government is undoubtebly the root of obesity amongst children, it is completely up to the parents to either develop this problem or put limitations to it.",,,,,,7.5,"Some people believe that the government is responsible for the increase in obesity among children, while others think this issue is mainly due to other factors. In my view, although the government can play a role, it is not solely responsible for this problem. One important reason is that children’s eating and activity habits are largely shaped at home, where parents have direct control over what their children eat and how much they exercise. For instance, if a parent constantly keeps unhealthy snacks in the house or allows children to spend hours watching television, the likelihood of those children becoming obese increases. On the other hand, the government does influence the environment in which families make choices by allowing junk food advertising aimed at young audiences and failing to ensure healthy food options in schools. While governments could do more to promote healthier lifestyles, such as running public health campaigns or improving school lunches, the primary responsibility still lies with families to teach good habits. Therefore, I believe that the rise in childhood obesity is mostly due to personal and family choices, even though the government should also provide support and guidance."

As a result, they put their own health at stake because obesity have strong negative effects on it. Nevertheless, I believe that governments are not responsible for the rise in obesity in children as they often warn people to avoid unhealthy food, and advise them to stay in good physical condition by promoting physical activity.
On the one hand, there are some people who claim that governements are responsible for this phenomenon because they do not prevent big companies of fast food like Mac Donald from spreading in the country. As a result, they think that children will be increasingly attracted by this type of food.
However, I do not agree with this argument. For example, USA governement has invested a lot of money in the promotion of organic food for children. In fact, more advertisements about that can now be seen regularly on TV. Moreover, a lot of canteens in schools in America have been obliged to propose healthy menus which contain organic food for children in order to keep them in good health.
On the other hand, other people argue that governments are keen on making profit, so they prefer to promote TV programms for children, which are very addictive, rather than physical activity. Consequently, young people do not want to do sport as they do not move constantly, so they gain weight easily.
Nevertheless, I find this argument not relevant because evidence shows that children are more active than ever before nowadays. For instance, in France, the government has constructed more than 50 000 sport facilities in the country over the 10 past years. This brought about a significant increase in children who practice sports regularly.
To conclude, I am conviced that governments all over the world have been putting a lot of efforts in order to prevent children from obesity, since most of them have promoted organic food as well as physical activity for young people.",,,,,,7.0,"Obesity among children has become an increasingly serious problem in many countries, and some people argue that the government should be blamed for this trend. However, I disagree with this point of view because I believe there are various factors beyond the government’s control that contribute to childhood obesity. While it is true that authorities could do more to regulate the marketing of junk food and encourage healthy eating, they have already taken several positive actions. For example, in many places, school lunches are required to meet certain nutrition standards and public health campaigns emphasize the dangers of consuming too much sugar and fat. Additionally, many governments have invested in building parks and sports centers, making physical activity more accessible for everyone. Despite these efforts, family habits and individual choices play a much larger role. Parents often choose what their children eat at home, and with the widespread availability of technology, many children spend their free time indoors on electronics rather than being active outside. In conclusion, although the government has some responsibility to support healthy lifestyles, I think the main causes of childhood obesity are related to parental guidance and personal habits rather than government action alone."

A lot of people may agree with this because they think that the government does not take measures to stop selling high sugar products, which may cause obesity, in schools. Moreover, they may suggest that government is also responsible for junk food advertisements because it is not forbidden yet. For instance, if children see a french fries and hamburgers advertisement in cartoons they are watching, they may want to eat fast food every day to be like their favourite cartoon character who enjoys the same meal.

Yet, other people are convinced that parents and families have the biggest responsibility since they are the ones who actually decide what their kids eat and how much exercise they get. It is common to see that children who grow up in homes where healthy living is encouraged tend to have better habits. From my own perspective, both sides share responsibility.

For example, authorities in some countries have banned sugary drinks or fast food in school cafeterias as an effort to promote better eating habits. On the other hand, parents are the ones most closely involved in their children's daily lives, and their choices about food and physical activity have the biggest impact. If a family often eats takeout meals and prefers watching television over exercising together, children are more likely to follow their example. From my personal observation, children whose parents spend time preparing nutritious meals and engage with their kids in sports or outdoor games are much less likely to struggle with weight issues. In conclusion, although governments have the power to help reduce childhood obesity through policies and education, I think it is inaccurate to say they are solely responsible, since the family environment and broader culture also play central roles in shaping children's health habits."
551,2,Write about the following topic.Many parents today organise extra classes for their children after school and at the weekends.Do you feel that this is a worthwhile thing to do or do you feel children have enough education at school?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"With the development of society, people have been paying more attention to children's education. Every parent hopes that their kids can have better and more skilled to face the challenges in the future. At this time, extra classes came into being. Besides the lessons in school, children will attend different kinds of extra classes, such as classes on sports, maths, languages, arts. In my opinion, it is a worthwhile thing to do, but children shouldn't be given too much pressure.
Students in school usually have 5-6 classes, and after school they need develop their hobbies and have more time to do outdoor activities with their friends or classmates. In class , they get the knowledge from teachers and textbooks while after school they learn from experiencing the life, getting into nature and make connections by social skills. So I think students can have some extro classes not for studing the knowledge but for experencing, developing, and make themselves be themselves, become a whole person.
My son is an active boy who loves sports and he is into riding horses, play badminton and swimming. So I chose to take him to the club of horse riding on Tuesday after school . On Thursday, he will go to attend the swiming class with his friends. They not only learn the swimming skills from teacher but aslo have geat fun, and I always see his smiling face. I found that more sports and hobbies can really make the kids feel relaxed instead of some bored extra maths, languages classes. Kids need improve and learn new skills so as to have a better and brighter future, extra classes are needed ,but not too many or not too heavy. Be a whole person and be themselves is more important.",,,,,,5.0,"In today's world, many parents choose to enrol their children in extra classes after normal school hours or on weekends, hoping to give them an added advantage for the future. Personally, I believe that this can be beneficial as long as it is balanced and does not overwhelm the child. School provides children with essential academic foundations, but extra classes can help them explore other interests, such as music, dance, or sports, and develop skills that are not always covered in the standard curriculum. For example, I know a girl in my neighbourhood who attends art classes every Saturday, and she has grown much more confident in expressing herself. At the same time, it is important for children to have time for rest and play, as these activities are necessary for social development and mental health. If children are forced into too many extra academic lessons, they might feel stressed and lose interest in learning altogether. Therefore, I think it is a good idea for parents to arrange some extra classes for their children, but the focus should be on letting them discover and enjoy their passions, rather than simply adding academic pressure."

Parents have much struggles on the arrangement regarding additional classes out of school to their children in order to gain the competitive advantages in their future career. This eassy attempts to find out the main considerations on this.
There is no doubt that school curriculum largely focuses on academic studies, including physical, Maths and organic chemistry etc., Those subjects are designed to connect with learning in a higher education. It is reasonable to say that this curriculum may not enable the teenagers to gain various knowledeges aspects of digital world and our planet. Learning in extra classes out of syllabus is an opportunity for them to really discover what they may be passionate about and in turn, help them develop new skills that may come in handy for a future occupation that is related.

As a result, it could lead to undesired results or even negative impacts on the parent-child relationship, so maybe it's best for children to figure it out on their own sometimes.
My take on this is that younsters are extremely inquisitive and energetic, consequently, it's really the prime time of their life to explore and learn new things. Studying in classes outside the syllabus are good intention, but children are forced to learn what their parents love to only. This not only ruins the parent-child relationship but also may results in children's resistance to learning.",,,,,,7.5,"In recent times, it has become common for parents to arrange additional classes for their children outside of regular school hours. Some people argue this practice is useful, as it gives students a competitive edge, while others feel formal education at school should be sufficient. Personally, I believe extra classes can be beneficial if used appropriately, but there are drawbacks if overdone. The main advantage of these classes is that they allow children to develop skills or knowledge not covered in the school curriculum, such as learning a musical instrument, a foreign language, or advanced math. This extra learning can help children discover new interests and prepare them better for future academic or career challenges. However, it is also important to consider that children need time to relax, socialise, and pursue hobbies that are not strictly educational. If their schedules are filled only with lessons and homework, they might become stressed or even lose motivation to learn. From my own observation, some classmates who attended many extra courses often seemed tired and less enthusiastic compared to those who had more free time. In conclusion, while extra classes can provide valuable opportunities, parents should ensure that their children’s time is balanced so they stay motivated and happy."

In other words, the technology introduced in schools helps many children to learn various subjects with different gadgets, such geography, art, maths by computers or history by means of audio-visual-techniques. However, I believe that children thanks to these appealing methods of learning have enough education and they need some time to unwind and experience their life with other activites.
To begin with, apply children to extra classes at the weekends has become an issue of debate by many people. I hold firmly to the belief that children after schools need to dedicate their free time on sports. However, sports and other physical activities help young people to enhance their concentration, self-esteem and cognitive skills, social skills with their peer group. For example the most popular and suitable to children are sports with teams, such as football, basketball etc... where children could learn how to collaborate with other mates and the leadership skills gained in sports can help kids to excel in school, life and in the workplace, such as organising a good teamwork.
On the other hand, there are few parents who argue that children need to attend extra classes at schools during the weekends. For instance, the world is still facing a global pandemic of covid-19, which caused many problems of attendency of students in many educational institutions due to various measures introduced. However this led many students to lazyness and reduction of methods of gaining knowledge, because it is widely believed that online lessons are not interactive as the lessons in presence.

Personally, I believe that while the intention behind extra classes is understandable, children usually receive enough education at school and benefit more from time spent on other activities. For one thing, schools nowadays offer a range of subjects and utilize modern teaching methods and resources, making the learning process comprehensive and engaging during normal hours. Therefore, I feel that piling on extra lessons may result in stress and fatigue, thereby reducing a child’s enthusiasm for learning. For example, when children are overscheduled, they may miss out on meaningful family time, hobbies, or simply unwinding, all of which are crucial for their overall development. On the other hand, I understand that in some cases, extra classes can help students who are struggling or need to catch up, particularly if they missed important lessons due to illness or other difficulties. However, in general, I am convinced that letting children have free time to play, interact with friends, and pursue interests beyond academics is essential to help them grow as well-rounded individuals."

However, I personally feel that most children receive enough education at school and that extra classes can put unnecessary pressure on them. Children spend many hours each day in lessons, learning a wide variety of subjects under the supervision of trained teachers, and they need time to rest, play, and develop social skills in informal settings. For instance, after-school free time allows children to take part in hobbies like painting, playing music, or simply spending time with friends, all of which are essential for their emotional development and creativity. Furthermore, constantly attending extra lessons may make students feel overwhelmed or even resentful towards learning, causing stress and mental fatigue. While there may be situations, such as catching up after illness or falling behind, where extra help is useful, in most cases, giving children a healthy balance between study and leisure activities is more beneficial for their overall growth. Therefore, in my opinion, extra classes should be reserved for special circumstances and not become a routine part of every child’s life."
559,2,"Write about the following topic.Some people think that it is more beneficial to take part in sports which are played in teams, like football. But others think taking part in individual sports is better, like swimming. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","With the prevalence of sports nowadays, whether taking part in sports as a team or an individual is more beneficial has sparked off a lively debate. While many believe that playing sports as teams can elevate one's teamwork skills, others believe that playing sports alone can develop self-determination and confidence. Given that sports can be played in either conditions, I would like to discuss both perspectives before giving my opinion.
When it comes to sports, most people would think of team sports such as football, basketball and volleyball. These kinds of sports can help us to evolve important life skills. Especially for children, playing team sports is an indispensible method to develop interpersonal skills. Working as a teammate helps one to build relations and communicate with one another, distributing responsibilities. As a result, the skills the children learnt will be used to cope with future life as teenagers and adults.
Although playing sports alone will not gain any benefits from what I have mentioned above, it will help us to establish skills for an individual, such as self-determination and confidence, as well as concentrate for a long period. For instance, individual sports such as swimming and karate, require sportspeople to build their bravery, as well as formulate techniques to face their opponents. Therefore, even though working in teams can develop better abilities, we should not overlook the fact that doing sports as one can also volatilize its advantage.
Having discussed how sports played alone and as a group can develop corresponding skills, from my perspective, I reckon that playing sports in teams is more beneficial. Almost all walks of life require communication with others, so skills developed in teams are more advantageous then those in person.",,,,,,8.0,"Nowadays, the debate over whether team sports or individual sports are more advantageous is gaining significant attention. Supporters of team sports such as basketball or hockey argue that these settings nurture essential social abilities, including communication, cooperation, and leadership. When individuals participate in team-based activities, they must learn to work together, trust one another, and respond constructively to both victories and setbacks, skills which are highly valuable in both educational and professional environments. Conversely, proponents of individual sports like tennis or swimming claim that these disciplines promote self-reliance, perseverance, and personal responsibility. Since success or failure lies solely in the hands of the participant, individual athletes gain a strong sense of motivation and resilience, which can translate into greater self-confidence. For example, as a student who practiced both soccer and track, I noticed that the teamwork I developed in soccer helped me communicate better with classmates, while the discipline gained from running alone allowed me to focus and push myself independently. In conclusion, although both team and individual sports have unique benefits, I believe that team sports offer a broader range of essential life skills, particularly for developing interpersonal abilities that are vital throughout one’s life."

However, which between individual or team is most useful and salutary is a question that stir up fierce debate amongst public opinion.
To start with, beginning a team sport activity since from the childhood has countless advantages, first of all, it helps connecting athletes one another in an engaging and ever- stimulating experience.
Secondly, by empowering players of sharing tasks with the team, both empathy and discipline will be developed.
Nevertheless, the most common shortcoming of playing in a team is that often one’s overall performance can be restrained by constantly hewing to a strict tactics which leave no room for bold or creative moves, stifling any prospective talent on the rise.
In contrast, individual sports require a precise mindset and the natural flair for breaking the mold along with the urge to take on themselves in a never-ending clash under the banner of “ may the best man win”.
However, anyone can undertake such an activities, whose undoubtedly beneficial health effects, come into their own.
Although the spirit of challenge is equally through the roof in comparison with team sports, the absence of mates to confront with may, in the long run, leads the individual player to become decidedly more reclusive and self-reliant.
According to my experience, I would not have become companionable and self-reliant if I had not joined the basketball team when I was 9 years old. Moreover, playing with others, has helped me to pushing my limits further ahead without breaching those of my teammate, being a sort of example to follow and a beacon to turn to, in case of needs.",,,,,,6.0,"There has long been discussion around whether it is preferable to engage in team sports, like basketball or football, or to focus on individual disciplines, such as tennis or swimming. Advocates of team sports often highlight the fact that such activities teach important social values, including collaboration, communication, and leadership. When participating as a member of a group, individuals develop a sense of responsibility, as well as the recognition that personal efforts contribute to the overall success of the team. In addition, those who play team sports frequently form friendships that can last for years and provide emotional support during tough times. On the other hand, proponents of individual sports maintain that these activities foster independence, persistence, and self-discipline, as the responsibility for both victories and defeats rests solely on the athlete’s shoulders. Being able to set one's own pace and goals, as in running or martial arts, can empower individuals to push their limits and grow from personal challenges, often without the pressure of letting others down. From my own experience, I enjoyed both participating in a school volleyball team and competing in solo marathons, yet I believe that team sports offer a unique environment where essential social skills and mutual encouragement are more naturally cultivated. Therefore, although both forms of physical activity have significant merits, I think playing team sports brings greater overall benefits, especially in terms of building character and social connections."

To my point of view, I prefer individual sports over team sports as the latter is more harmful and less beneficial from both physical and mental perspective.
Firstly, I think sports played in groups tend to cause more harm in the forms of stress and injuries. To start, virtually all team sports are played as competitions: it must have a winnner and a loser, or losers. Since no one wish to be the stepstone of the champion, it causes a tremendous amount of stress on players' psyche. Also, many team sports inevitably requires phyiscal contacts of the players, the competitive nature of such sports often intensify the contact which some leads to injuries. Many famous sportsmen, like Jianlian Yi, one of the only two Chinese basketball players in NBA, were forced to retire early due to the injuries sustained during matches.
On the other hand, individual sports like swimming and joggling do not have such issues. Since one can swim or run alone, there is no such need to compete with others and cause stress. The removal of physical contact with other players also reduce the likelihood of sport injuries such as head-to-head collisions. Plus, one would focus more on how to self-improve on his/her phyiscal abilities. Moreover, some individual sports like joggling and hiking encourage people to explore mother nature. According to a study done by UBC in 2005, the higher exposure to the nature, one will have lesser likelihood to suffer mental disorders such as major depressions disorder (MDD) and general anxiety disorder (GAD).
In conclusion, I would say sports that played individually is has more benefits than team sports, from both the physical and mental point of views.",,,,,,7.5,"There is much debate about whether team sports like football or individual sports such as swimming are more advantageous. Supporters of team sports argue that playing with others builds teamwork skills, communication, and a sense of belonging. Through interacting with teammates, individuals can improve their social abilities and learn valuable lessons in cooperation and leadership. Additionally, it can be motivating to work toward a common goal, which often helps players push themselves harder. On the other hand, proponents of individual sports believe that these activities are more beneficial because they allow participants to set their own pace and focus entirely on personal improvement. This can cultivate self-discipline and independence, as well as reduce the pressure that sometimes arises from relying on teammates. For example, swimmers can track their progress and adjust techniques without worrying about letting others down. In my view, while team sports offer significant social benefits, individual sports are more flexible and better suited for those who prefer self-driven growth. Ultimately, both types of sports have their merits, but I lean toward individual sports because of the opportunity for personal development and control over one’s achievements."

569,2,Write about the following topic.Some teachers think that international student exchange would be beneficial for all teenage school students.Do you think its advantages will outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The international student exchange is getting more popular in many high schools in big cities. This operation brings many advantages which would be beneficial for teenager students. Though, here some disadvantages still exist.
Firstly, I think one of disadvantages is that lack of supervision on the international exchange teenagers as they are living in other countries. In general speaking, the youths felt strange and inadaptable at initial period. They can’t speak well foreign language, can’t communicate well with other classmates or teachers, so they might feel alone and isolate from a new circumstance. If they can’t adjust themselves well to fit in with groups as soon as possible, they will encounter more difficult things, such as studying, social and daily routine. The worse situation is that they might give up their studying, even they will mislead them into crime.
On the contrary, the advantages are far more than disadvantages. For example, youths will extend their horizons. They will see and know many new things what they never seen in domestic. They would easily accept those new things than adults, because youths have curiosities all long. Furthermore, the teenagers easier to make new friends in other countries, because they are always passion and single-minded. In order to communicate with different background students from all over the world, they must cultivate their social capacities harder than before. It is the best way to elevate their skills of the foreign language is communication. Moreover, through the different viewpoint collisions the international exchange students have gained multiple and scientific logics, which will have a profound impact at the rest their lives. However, I think the simplest advantage is that most the international exchange students have possessed with an excellent foreign language ability after then come back.
At the end of my essay, I think it is not suit for all teenagers to be the international exchange students. Here the teenagers must accept some selection processes under the fair and effective principles.",,,,,,5.5,"International student exchange programs are becoming increasingly common in schools, and many teachers believe that these experiences offer great benefits for teenagers. In my view, the advantages of such programs definitely outweigh the disadvantages. One possible negative aspect is that some students may struggle to adapt to new environments at first, especially when it comes to language barriers and unfamiliar customs. This can lead to feelings of homesickness or isolation, and not every young person can easily overcome these challenges. However, I believe these initial difficulties are temporary and can actually encourage students to become more independent and resilient. The positives are much more significant: by participating in an exchange, students can improve their language skills much faster than by studying only in a classroom, and they have a chance to learn about new cultures directly. These experiences broaden perspectives and teach valuable life lessons, such as understanding different viewpoints and becoming more adaptable in unfamiliar situations. For example, a friend of mine who studied abroad returned home with not only better English, but also a new outlook on her own culture and increased confidence in meeting new people. Overall, while student exchanges are not without challenges, the benefits for personal growth and education are greater, making such programs a good opportunity for many teenagers."
571,2,Write about the following topic.Some teachers think that international student exchange would be beneficial for all teenage school students.Do you think its advantages will outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Many teachers believe that an international exchange program would benefit all adolescent students. While there are clear drawbacks to this, in my opinion the advantages are more significant. The essay will demonstrate that pupils will build life skills by joining the program. This is followed by explaining why continuing learning in the domestic school after finishing the exchange can be practicable.
It is obvious that the exchange program is likely to give an opportunity for students to learn to live with people from different society and nationality which is the experience that they are not able to have when studying in their country. As a result, they will have the ability to communicate with various types of people and handle challenging situations. Furthermore, there is research indicating that pupils who study in another country are able to lead a group of acquaintances under pressure.
On the other hand, those who oppose this may point out that when the exchange complete and the students resume their courses in the domestic school, they are perhaps unable to keep pace with others and, consequently, there might be some students who cannot pass exams. Nevertheless, the aforementioned issue can possibly be addressed by teachers to arrange extra classes for the students in order for them to learn about what they have missed when they attended the exchange program.
In conclusion, despite the fact that some students may find difficulty in carrying on studies in the school after the completion of the exchange, I am convinced that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. This is because children are likely to gain valuable experience which they can only have when studying aboard.",,,,,,6.5,"Some educators suggest that international student exchange programs are highly advantageous for teenage learners, and I tend to agree that the benefits overshadow the shortcomings. First, participating in such exchanges exposes students to new cultures and perspectives, which can improve their ability to adapt and relate to people worldwide. For instance, a friend of mine who joined an exchange in Germany came back with better language skills and a much broader understanding of global issues. Although there are concerns that students might fall behind in their home country’s curriculum, this problem can be handled through preparatory lessons before departure and catch-up sessions upon return. Furthermore, living abroad often encourages greater independence and personal growth, skills that are valuable lifelong. Therefore, while challenges exist, the positive outcomes, such as enhanced communication skills and greater maturity, are likely to give teenagers an edge both academically and personally."
573,2,Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. Discuss both views.,"International sport events such as the Olympics and the World Cup tend to be the center of attention when they are held. While many people believe that being the location of the events can bring tremendous advantages to the host, others argue that the preparation does not worth the benefits. This essay will examine the opinions of both sides.
To begin with, an international sport tournament leads to an abruptly economic growth as it attracts a large number of sports fans from all around the globe. Being the destination of these visitors, all hotels in the city and neighbouring areas can be fully booked and local businesses surrounding will be in turmoil to serve the tourists. For example, the Olympics usually caused all accommodations around the hosting areas to be occupied and therefore, the city can obtain additional income by setting up temporary accommodations. Nevertheless, these opportunities usually come with enormous prices.
With the foregoing benefits, the hosting country needs to put enormous effort into preparation prior to the event. To elaborate, in order to welcome a countless amount of visitors, the country is required to invest in constructing, maintenance, and improvement of venues and various relevant locations. As a certain level of readiness and handling standards are expected from the fans, failing to meet the expectations can lead to negative reputations of the country. Furthermore, the hosting country will also have to bear the risks that may impact the event. For example, if there is any force majeure such as a pandemic, the event may be postponed or even cancelled.
To conclude, the occurance of international sports events can bring significant devlopments to the host in an exchange of a great deal of investments and risks. Thus, the government must consider thoroughly before deciding to step in.",,,,,,6.0,"International sports events like the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics are often seen as opportunities for a country to shine on a global stage, but opinions differ regarding their overall value. On one hand, supporters believe that hosting such events generates financial profit and fosters national pride. Large crowds pour into the host nation, bringing revenue to hotels, restaurants, and local shops, and media coverage introduces the country’s culture to a worldwide audience. For example, South Korea saw a growth in tourism after hosting the Winter Olympics in 2018, and the event also encouraged improvements in transportation and infrastructure. On the other hand, critics argue that the cost of preparing for these events can be overwhelming, sometimes outweighing the advantages. Building stadiums and improving facilities require billions of dollars, which may never be fully recovered, especially if the structures are not used much after the games end. Additionally, there may be disruption to residents’ daily lives and the risk of social problems if investments fail. In summary, while hosting international sports events can provide opportunities for economic and cultural benefit, the potential financial burden and risks must be considered carefully before deciding to become a host nation."
575,2,Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. Discuss both views.,"Certain people believe that organizing international sports competitions could benefit host countries. While hosting sport events might also entail risks, I firmly believe that nations would gain much more than they would lose, as I will explain below.
International sport competitions are usually large events that bring together thousands of people including athletes, staff, and tourists. This usually represents an attractive opportunity for local business and investors. People need to be fed, thus activating restaurants' economy. Additionally, they need a place to sleep and rest, which would benefit hotels. On the other hand, many countries hosting international competitions build new infrastructure, including stadiums, pools, public squares, and even airports. It is clear that several cities around the world have developed as a result of hosting such events. Let us take the example of the city Montreal in Canada, which hosted the olympic games a few decades ago. Organizing sports events also represents an opportunitty to improve the international image of a country. For example, it is not a secret that some countries such as Germany and Russia have used the World Cup to improve their international image, with positive results overall. Finally, since inhabitants of the host nation would feel inspired to practice a new sport, we could argue that competitions could additionally improve the health and wellbeing of citizens in the long term.
It is important to mention, however, that hosting sport events might also entail some risks. These competitions are usually complex and expensive to organize, and middle- or low-income economies could better use their resources to build vital infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. Moreover, examples around the world illustrate that some politicians see these events as an opportunity for curruption.
In conclusion, there are more benefits than risks for countries when it comes to hosting international sport events. These events might translate into economic opportunities for local business and investors, could bring new infrastructure, and may trigger development.",,,,,,7.0,"Some argue that hosting international sports events can bring several advantages to a country, while others caution that the drawbacks might be greater. On the positive side, staging such competitions usually encourages tourism, as visitors from all over the world come to watch the games and explore the local culture. This boost in tourism leads to higher revenues for local shops, restaurants, and hotels, thus benefiting the local economy. Moreover, major sports events can motivate governments to upgrade public facilities, including transportation systems and sporting venues, improvements that serve the population long after the event ends. These occasions can also promote national pride and unity, as citizens come together to support their athletes. Despite these potential benefits, some people point out significant downsides. Hosting international sports gatherings typically demands immense spending, and many nations end up with costly facilities that are underused once the event is finished. There is also a risk of increased debt and the possibility of social unrest if citizens believe that too much public money is being allocated to these events instead of critical services like healthcare and education. In conclusion, while hosting major sports events can offer unique opportunities for economic gain and development, careful planning and management are necessary to avoid financial difficulties and ensure that the long-term gains outweigh the temporary excitement."

However, many would argue that such events are a waste of useful resources, which could otherwise be streamlined to more needed areas. Although I am of the opinion that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, in this essay I will discuss both viewpoints with the help of relevant examples.
To support my view, I would like to bring to attention the 2009 Olympics held in China, which brought individuals from all over the world. The funds collected from the event provided a massive boost to the economy of the country, a significant portion of which was utilised for the welfare of underprivileged children in the nation.
On the other hand, it is imperative to note that a majority of profits gained from these shows go to the upper classes. For example, the IPL tournaments held in India have seemingly benefitted the uber rich participating in the auctions, while simultaneously draining tax-payers of their money.
However, coming from a community where sports serves as a bonding activity, I would also like to elaborate on the non-economic benefits of these games. The Olympic Games, for instance, garner a mass crowd from various nations bringing a variety of individuals together. They act as a nidus for soothing political tensions and improve diplomatic relations in times of unrest.
While many may object to the violent nature of some sports such as boxing, and the impact they have on young minds, these activities also serve as a conversation starter and are likely to ignite a spark of interest for sports in many.

Supporters point to the global attention and economic growth these events attract, such as the vast number of tourists arriving and increased spending in hotels, transportation, and restaurants. For example, the FIFA World Cup in South Africa opened up job opportunities and led to the construction of new infrastructure, which improved the daily lives of citizens even after the games ended. On the other hand, critics emphasize that the short-term economic boom often fails to cover the long-term costs, with stadiums sometimes left unused, becoming costly burdens on the nation’s budget. They also argue that funds spent on sports events could be better allocated towards pressing needs like healthcare and education. Despite these criticisms, these events do more than just benefit the economy—they bring people from diverse backgrounds together and foster a sense of national pride. It is this unique cultural influence, alongside the financial gains, that makes hosting international sports events a worthwhile endeavor, although careful planning is essential to ensure the benefits are shared more broadly throughout society."

Supporters believe these occasions can greatly boost tourism and create jobs, as was seen during the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, where countless visitors brought revenue and development to local businesses. Additionally, the attention drawn can inspire a sense of national pride, uniting citizens and encouraging investment in infrastructure and facilities that may serve communities long after the event concludes. Conversely, critics argue that the substantial costs of building stadiums and preparing the city often outweigh the temporary advantages. For instance, the 2016 Olympics in Brazil left the country with unused venues and financial strain, raising concerns about misallocation of public funds that could have been directed towards healthcare or education. Another point of contention is that these events sometimes displace local residents and disrupt daily life, sparking public protests and resentment. Despite these drawbacks, I personally believe the positive impacts such as improved international reputation and long-term sporting enthusiasm usually outweigh the negative, as long as the events are managed with careful planning and consideration for local needs."
581,2,Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. Discuss both views.,"The topic indicates the international sports events could bring beneficial for a country. There are several aspects to approve as below:
Firstly, international sports events could increase economical income and stimulate domestic consumption. An international sports event usually attracts a lot of audiences and tourists come to host country during the event is holding. A lot of people produce tremendous consumptions which include match tickets, transportation fees , accommodation and shopping costs. Moreover, international sports events will attract many sponsors, both oversea and domestic. They might find the new financial opportunity to extend their further investments in host country. For example, 2018 FIFA World Cup held in Russia where attracted many thousands of tourists flooded into the country and created a huge sum profits.
Secondly, international sports events help to develop country's infrustructures and facilities. For example, in order to hold the 2008 BeiJing Olympic Game China built the nation stadium , nation swimming center and Olympic community so on. Furthermore, the first high speed train started to shuttle from Bei Jing to Tian Jin. In next two decades , more and more high speed trains shuttle in China. Thirdly, an international sports event will efficiently encourage the citizens devoted more passions and enthusiasms to participate in it. For example, Bei Jing is the host city to held the 2022 Winter Olympic Game, which encourage a lot of Chinese to learn and participate these winter sports, like snowboard, skating. Fourth, there is an opportunity to perform various cultures and histories of country to all visitors. Meanwhile, international sports events successfully held in a country that will enhance its international influence and the reputation in international stage.
Generally speaking, international sports events could bring various beneficial development, not only for country but also for individuals.",,,,,,6.0,"Some people consider that hosting international sports events brings many advantages for a country, while others think it may cause problems. On one hand, when a nation organizes such events, the country attracts many visitors from around the world, which becomes a chance for local businesses to earn more money, especially in hotels, restaurants, and tourist attractions. Large companies also become interested to sponsor the events, helping the host country to receive more investments. Moreover, preparing for international sports competitions may encourage the government to enhance infrastructure, such as building new stadiums, improving roads, or upgrading public transportation, which continues to benefit people after the event is finished. However, some people believe that hosting an international sports event can be risky. The high costs of building big facilities or security arrangements may place a heavy burden on government budget. Sometimes, after the event, those facilities are not used much and become wasteful. There is also a risk of increasing traffic jams or pollution because of so many tourists visiting at once. In conclusion, hosting international sports events may result in economic opportunities and improved facilities, but there are also disadvantages that should not be ignored. Each country needs to carefully consider these factors before deciding to host international sports events."

Is this a positive or negative development for sports?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is considered by many nowadays that sports has become a lucrative industry for the sports personals and companies bidding on teams and sports people . Though, there are positive's and negative's considering how humongous the money making business around sports has evolved , the postives outweighs the negatives, which is also my opinion .
Firstly, over the years number of people involving directly by playing a sport or indirectly by watching it has increased . This creates pressure in sports personal and the management to provide quality sports which itself is costly considering the prices of telecasting and the technological advances. Secondly, giving the sports personal proper financial aid ,boosts their performance ,as most of the athletes come from a humble background . Providing financial aid also helps them to buy quality sports gear . Thirdly , most people drop their ambition of taking sports due to poor payments than other sectors , so giving them salaries is quite hard for the sports management if there are no sponsors .
The business around sports has been everblooming, be it in the form of owning, sponsoring or betting. The companies, involve in sports industry with a motive of advertising their brands on large scale ,which otherwise ,is an unachievable task . The betting industry has been rising ,as it is highly lucrative considering the time and resources spent .
On the other hand , people also believed that too much of flow of money has created corruption in the sports sector . The example of DLF IPL scam by Lalit Modi supports the argument of such people , commonwealth scam is also one such. The people in betting are luring players with money and fixing matches for their monetary gains which is killing the spirit of the game.
In conclusion, I support that high earnings in sports industry has had a positive impact on the quality of sports played and also being delivered on televisions with such quality.",,,,,,6.5,"In recent years, sports has transformed into a massive business, generating enormous profits for athletes, teams, and the companies associated with it. While this commercialization brings certain drawbacks, I believe the positive effects are more significant. To begin with, the financial growth in sports leads to better infrastructure, advanced training, and better support for players, all of which raise the overall standard of performance. Many talented individuals from underprivileged backgrounds are encouraged to pursue careers in sports due to the attractive pay and sponsorship opportunities. Additionally, large sums spent on broadcasting have made it possible for fans around the world to follow their favorite events with excellent coverage and technology. Companies who invest in sports use it to promote their brands, which benefits both the sports organizations and the businesses themselves. However, critics argue that large profits can result in corruption and unethical behavior, such as match-fixing and unfair endorsements, which damage the spirit of fair play. Despite these concerns, my view is that the financial development in sports mostly benefits athletic performance, fan experience, and the livelihood of those involved. In conclusion, although there are negative aspects, the high earnings in sports business overall contribute positively to the growth and popularity of sports worldwide."

It presents not only the professional players and companies with high earnings, also gain reputations in their fields. From personal view, I think the phenomenon is a negative development. But, from professional players and companies, I think the phenomenon is a positive development.
At first, as an audience, a fan or a consumption, I have to pay more costs for watching sports events or purchasing sport commodities than before. For example, the sport shoes from Nike and Adidas have risen in their prices up year by year. Thus, I think the phenomenon is a negative development. Secondly, on the contract, as professional players, particularly some very famous athletes who have a lot of proponents and gain high reputations all over the world. They have the abilities to create wealth. Besides, they have profound influences and authorities which inspire more people to engage in the sport. For example, Lional Messi, a world-famous soccer player, and Roger Federe, an iconic tennis player. Both they have a lot of followers, some of them are willing to contribute their money and passions to these sports.

From my perspective, this development brings both positive and negative impacts to the world of sports. On the positive side, the high earnings encourage professional players to perform at their best, attracting more young people to pursue sports as a career. For example, basketball stars like LeBron James not only gain wealth but also motivate millions of children worldwide to practice diligently and dream big. Additionally, companies involved in sports, such as Nike and Adidas, can invest more in improving equipment and organizing greater events, which eventually benefit the quality and excitement of sports competitions. However, there are also downsides. Ticket prices and merchandise have become much more expensive, making it harder for ordinary fans to attend matches or support their favorite teams.

I strongly disagree with this statement because this would not solve the initial problem and could turn out expensive as well.
Firstly, banning mobile devices from certain places would be exagerated. This is because smoking actually damages your body, while the use of mobile phones is comparatively harmless. For example, a recent research found out that the risk of lung cancer grows by 0,02% with every cigarette, while high screen time has less damaging side effects like the loss of concentration. Altough the use of mobile phones is sometimes antisocial, I think that we should concentrate on the origins of this problem than simply prohibit it in certain areas.
Secondly, banning mobile devices would have a regulatory side effect which could be expensive. The government would have to decide on new laws as well as implement them. Furthermore, it would be no easy task for the police to control these rules in an efficient way. As a result, police would struggle with a high workload. Admittely, I have enough faith in our legal system and I am sure that they could manage it but I think that we have more prescious und urgent tasks to concentrate on.

For instance, events like the Olympics or the World Cup show how athletes can achieve incredible performances thanks to advanced facilities and resources provided by big investments. Secondly, the business side of sports helps develop local economies, as stadiums, merchandise, and televised games create jobs and bring in tourism. Admittedly, there are some downsides, such as the risk of athletes focusing more on money than fair play or health, but overall the benefits are noticeable.

589,2,Write about the following topic.Group or team activities can teach more important skills for life than those activities which are done alone.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Doing activities, either in a group or alone, play a crucial factor in terms of self-development, leading to strong skills for people’s life. Despite the fact that individual activities can improve a wide variety of people’s competencies, I personally believe that people would gain more benefits from participating team activities than doing individually.
It is true that group activities potentially strengthen people’s social skills. An argument in favour of this is that team activities require participants to collaborate with other team members. As a result, the participants will not only have to do their responsibility the best, but also helping others bring out their best potential. This is because a team cannot achieve its goal by any person, but by everyone working together. Another common example is that group activities also foster people’s communication skills. In order to get what the team aim to succeed, each team members must deliver their messages via conversation in the simple and understandable way. Therefore, people doing group activities are likely to expose with this experience all time, helping them being capable of communicating effectively.
In spite of the aforementioned advantages of doing activities as a team, it is the fact that doing individual activities also contributes to many essential skills. A classic example of this is the development in self-discipline. With respect to sports, people who doing sports alone such as running must strict with their running schedule in order to being able to run for their target distance. Another common criticism is the ability to not comparing themselves with others. When people doing activities alone, they will have to set their milestones to reach their target, meaning that they will truly understand their actual potential and not interfered by other people’s progress.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that individual activities possibly help people have self-discipline and teach them to concentrate on their ability, not others. Nevertheless, after carefully contemplating the outcomes of both types of activities, I totally agree that group activities which result in better teamwork and communication skills are more important due to the fact that these competencies are the two most important factors for every people to be successful in life.",,,,,,6.5,"Participating in group or team activities plays a significant role in the development of essential life skills, often providing greater benefits than activities done alone. I am convinced that the unique advantages of teamwork surpass those of individual pursuits. Engaging in group activities allows people to learn how to cooperate and adapt to the needs of others, which is crucial in both personal and professional settings. For instance, when working on a group project at school or addressing tasks at a workplace, team members must combine their strengths and support each other, teaching patience and conflict resolution along the way. Additionally, being involved in team activities improves one’s ability to communicate clearly, as exchanging ideas and offering constructive feedback contribute to the group’s overall success. While it is true that individual activities nurture independence and discipline, these qualities are often more applicable to personal achievements rather than situations that require collaboration. In my own life, participating in school sports teams and group assignments has helped me understand the importance of teamwork, responsibility, and empathy. Therefore, I firmly believe activities conducted in groups are more effective at teaching vital skills needed throughout life."

Both ones are important in teaching life skills. Below, we will see which one of them is a great way of teaching more important life skills.
First of all, we need to understand that doing activities in group, or as a team can help us deepen our knowlodge, because they provide us with the ability to share ideas and learn from each other which is something crucial in our daily lives as human being as we were all created to live together as communities. In addition, group or team activities will not only allow us to know the other person living next us but to figure out what their feelings are and to be patient to them when they need us. However, doing activities alone have also its own benefits.
In fact, personal activities or some of them we do alone can give us some understanding about how the world is spinning around us as well. Firsthand, sometimes we need to do a few activities alone as this can help us to develop some personal important life skills to know exacly who we really are and what is our mission on the earth. Second, doing personal activities such as walking out, or going for a walk will not only strengthen our physical being but also to be mentally healthy.
In conclusion, both of them have positive and negative aspects to consider. However, in my opinion, doing activities in group or as a team can teach more important life skills than those activities which are done alone because group activities let us explore the world around us which will later teach us important skills which are necessary for our survival.",,,,,,6.5,"Group or team activities are an excellent way to learn important life skills, but there are also many activities done alone that help us grow as individuals. Teamwork teaches people how to communicate, listen, and solve problems together, which are all useful in real-life situations. For example, when working in a team sport like football or basketball, we have to learn how to cooperate with different personalities and come up with strategies that everyone agrees on. This reflects what we often need to do at work or in our families. On the other hand, doing some activities by ourselves, such as painting or reading, helps us to be more independent and understand ourselves better. When we take time alone, we can make decisions without any outside pressure and learn to be comfortable with our thoughts. In conclusion, I believe that group activities tend to teach more important life skills because in life we often interact with others, and being able to work well with people is necessary. However, the benefits of personal activities should not be ignored, as they also help us become well-rounded individuals."

This essay will argue why collaborating works against isolating ones are entirely necessary in gaining life abilities and competencies.
It is clear that People are usually different in their own characters and in their dealing with things. So that, some of them like to be alone and want to move on activities without sharing the others because they afraid of involving in troubles. They also think that the others may treat them jealously and enviously. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances of aggressive states inside learning circuses which sometimes made losing knowledge rather than winning new abilities. Moreover, those people may have deep fears and shy which constantly prevent them from growing among team works. For example many famous celebrities had become more creative by sitting alone. Such those ideas let people do not want to change their acceptable way in getting and learning skills for authentic life against team activities. In contrast, grouping work can overcome all obstacles in personality and teach people different kinds of skills.
Although some people can success in learning all they need individually, most of them whether their age and background eagerly need contacting the others to teach them lessons about realistic life skills. Cooperating concept is important in teaching people manners for adapting through life. As previous researches of Vojytsky has declared that learners always could build knowledge while interactions directly or indirectly with others. Overall the idea of sharing activities in order to give persons opportunity to learn values and new skills is completely true despite the minor improving of lonely ones' life.
This essay argued that it is had better getting bit new skills in team or group work ,on the other hand its useless way to teach people activities alone. In my opinion, it is quite important and interesting way to let people contacting and teaching each other a plenty of skills in the same time. However, it is long way to guide some people teaching themselves what they need throughout the life.

Personally, I strongly agree that participating in group activities is more effective for learning important skills needed in daily life. Working with others helps people improve their communication abilities, encourages cooperation, and teaches how to solve conflicts that might occur in a team. For example, during my time at school, I joined a project group where we had to finish a big assignment together. Through this, I learned how to listen to different ideas, share my opinions politely, and compromise when decisions had to be made. While doing activities alone can develop independence and personal responsibility, such tasks often do not offer the same opportunity to practice teamwork or adapt to the opinions and working styles of others. Moreover, in most professional environments, success depends on one’s ability to work well with colleagues, which requires the very skills learned in group settings. Therefore, I believe that group activities have a greater positive effect on preparing individuals for life than solitary activities, as they teach the essential abilities required for both personal and professional growth."

Personally, I think there are some good advantages team activities cause our life,
and especially in business scenes more comfortable and productive.
Initially, only one person's work is limited, compared with group activities. This means that working only one person will be able to cause some profits to some extent. On the other hand, group working will be more productive and efficient to make more sales figures. In addition, each person has a great ability. For example, some people have great communication skills and negotiations. Those people are
the most appropriate roles for sales. Furthermore, some people are good at analysing the group performance quality and making strategies. Those who are good at these activities are best for marketing team. As a result, they can focus on their strong points for work and they can divide and conquer the tasks with each other.
Of course, some people are eager to work alone at their own relaxed pace and make a profit to some extent. This is less stressful they do not need to keep attention from other colleagues. But this means that they need to decide all tasks and take all responsibility. Sometimes it might be risky once they made a mistake and caused a huge deficit.
Finally, there is no doubt that more than two heads are better than one. People can share their experiences and opinion to improve their group activities. If some people who are sensitive and feel pressure if some people meddle in too much. It is necessary to organize some rules that must be effective. For example, all people need to try to stay positive, avoid stating negative or swear words, and not deny one person's opinion straightforwardly and emotionally. Making a great atmosphere, saying positive words with each other, and including some humor, will lead to everyone's performance being more productive.",,,,,,7.0,"There is a common debate about whether group or solo activities are most valuable for building important life skills.

For example, when I played on a school football team, we always needed to discuss our strategies and support each other, which taught me to listen carefully and respect other opinions. These are useful skills that are needed not just in sports but also in workplaces and even in families. In contrast, doing work alone can help someone focus deeply, but it often does not offer much practice in cooperating with others or solving disagreements. Of course, some people feel more comfortable working alone, especially for activities that require concentration, such as writing or drawing. However, in real life, most situations require working together to achieve bigger goals, so learning to be a good team member is important.

Firstly, working in a group helps build teamworking skills. In a team, in order to be successful in doing peojects, members need to help one another in achieving mutual goals. Therefore, through these steps, team members will be trained on assisting others to reach the goal, although they may feel more competent undergoing a project on their own. Similarly, in real societies, people living in the same community cannot be careless to their neighbors and, instead, have to understand each other. Because of this understanding, they can tolerate one another.
Still, it can be argued that working collectively nurtures people to follow the crowd and hence, they cannot sharpen decision making skills. For this point, it is valid that a lone wolf has a clearer vision in its life direction than a pack of wolves that walk behind a leader. Still, a single leader may lead to a wrong path that ends up to a disaster for all other wolves. Thus, in order to make a right decision effectively, it is required that people work together since they can debate and negotiate what is appropriate for the team which, in turn, beneficial for each individual. Likewise, in a country, no single prime minister can dictate the country's direction. Nevertheless, opinions gathered from the parliament are necessary.
In conclusion, team projects are more useful in culminating skills crucial to live in a society. Teamworking skills gained from working together will lead to an understanding of other people not only in the team but in the same society. Moreover, people will be trained on negotiation and compromisation which yield better success than decisions done alone by a single person.",,,,,,7.0,"Group or team activities are often said to be more effective than individual activities for teaching essential life skills. On one hand, individual work certainly develops personal responsibility and independent thinking, which are important qualities for self-growth. However, I believe that participation in group activities enables people to acquire more significant abilities that are crucial for success in modern life. When working as part of a team, individuals learn to communicate ideas clearly and listen to the opinions of others, which strengthens their interpersonal skills. For example, during a group science project at school, I found that dividing the tasks among my teammates and collaborating to solve problems improved my ability to negotiate and compromise. Furthermore, group settings often require members to resolve conflicts and adapt to various personalities, which mirrors real-life situations in workplaces and communities. While working alone can encourage focus and self-sufficiency, group activities ultimately prepare people to function effectively within society, making them more valuable for developing life skills. Therefore, I agree that teamwork teaches more important lessons for life than working alone."
603,2,Today family members do not eat meals together. Why does this happen? Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Dinner tables are no longer a place for family reunion in today's society. Reasons from many aspects account for this phenomenon which pose a huge threat to the happiness of family and the harmony of society.
Causes vary from person to person. Some people, especially the young believing that conflicts are common on dinner tables, tend to have meals with their friends rather than their family members. But most people are deprived of their rights by the development of society. Too busy to get home at dinner time, people have to eat meals near workplace. Also, with the job diversity increasing, rarely can family members with different timetables eat meals at the same period. For instance, a bank agent getting home at 6 pm tends to miss her doctor husband leaving home at 5 pm for emergency work.
It is the advantages of sharing meals with family that attach great importance to this event. Time for communication is so critical that families lacking such opportunities are often full of misunderstandings and quarrels. Not only can this development increase the divorce rate but it may also decrease the marriage rate. Because support and care from family, the previous harbor, is deprived and people see no significance from getting married. With such phenomenon prevailing, the negative emotions may take advantage in the society. Loneliness, distress and helplessness stike those always eating alone.
In a nutshell, taking the damage to both families and societies into consideration, various solutions should be put forward to the roots behind the situation.",,,,,,7.0,"In modern society, it has become increasingly rare for family members to gather and enjoy meals together, and several factors contribute to this change. One major reason is the busy lifestyle that many people lead today; work commitments, school schedules, and extracurricular activities often force family members to eat at different times or even in different places. Furthermore, the growth of technology and fast food culture means individuals can eat quickly while distracted by their phones or televisions, making shared meals less of a priority. For example, children might prefer eating in their rooms while watching online videos, leading to a lack of interaction with parents. I believe this is a negative development because regular family meals provide an opportunity to strengthen bonds, share experiences, and support each other's emotional needs. Without these moments, misunderstandings and emotional distance can arise, weakening family ties. In summary, while the increasing individualism and busy schedules of today’s world may make separate meals unavoidable, the decline in shared family dining has harmful effects on both personal relationships and broader social cohesion."
605,2,Today family members do not eat meals together. Why does this happen? Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The topic indicated that the family members no longer eat meals together in the modern society. The reason are complex and the phenomenon is inevitable.
I think the first factor is that the pressure from the modern age has increased. More and more family members busy on their jobs and studies. They undergo more pressures than ever have before. For example, a father who very busy at work, he usually work extra hours and social with his clients. His schedule is volatile thus he has to give up his time to eat meals with his family members. The second factor is that family members have their own schedules in the fast-moving world. Furthermore, the more social activities lead sophisticated to people's lifestyle. For example, a family member who goes to fitness center after work, he eat by individual instead eat meal together. The third factor is that the scale of family members has decreased, more and more family members left their hometown for the new place, like urban or big city. They cannot eat together due to geographical separation. Probably a family member eat meals by individual whom might feel lonely and insulated.
On conclusion, this social phenomenon is an evident of the changing society. Obviously, family member eat meal together that help them to reinforce their relationships each other and create a good communication among them. It would be a happiness moment when family members eating together. But the fact we have to accept is that the society is changing.",,,,,,5.5,"In modern society, it has become common that family members do not eat meals together as they once did. There are several main reasons for this trend. Firstly, people’s lifestyles have changed greatly, and many family members have separate schedules due to work, school, or other commitments. For instance, students may stay late at school for extra classes or activities, while parents might work overtime or even hold two jobs. In addition, fast food and food delivery services make it easier for individuals to eat whenever and wherever they want, instead of waiting for the whole family. Another reason is that, as people move to cities, they may live far apart from their extended families or feel more independent, so family meals feel less necessary. In my opinion, this is a negative development because eating together is a valuable time for family members to connect, share their day, and support one another emotionally. When families miss out on these shared moments, relationships can become weaker, and individuals may feel isolated in their daily lives. For example, when I was younger, my family always had dinner together, and it helped me feel close to my parents and siblings. Now, with everyone so busy, we rarely eat together, and I feel this has made us less connected. In conclusion, although changing lifestyles have made shared meals less common, I believe this is an unfortunate loss to family life and society as a whole."
607,2,Today family members do not eat meals together. Why does this happen? Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Some people argue that people less frequently gather around a table at meals with their family members, due to a number of factors such as changing trends in the living style and weakened relations between parents and children. I strongly believe that this has a devastating effect on the future of society.
Compared to half of a century ago, the habits of especially big-city dwellers have experienced a dramatic shift in recent years. While people get used to living in extended families, today they tend to live in smaller families called celullar families. In the following step, isolation became much more significant that children aged over 18 years prefer to move to a separate house. Additionally, even individuals who live with their family rarely share daily activities including eating meals, mainly related to different and busy working schedules. Apparently, the residents of the metropolis are reluctant to spend their time because of the increased incidence of depression or other psychologic disorders.
A growing body of evidence indicates that as people choose to do their activities alone, their family bonds are also negatively affected. As a physician, from my point of view, children who are raised in this environment are more likely to become antisocial and unsuccessful in both academic and social life. Furthermore, most of these young persons suffer from psychiatric disorders which are remarkably infrequent among people who keep in touch with their relatives. Also, these youngsters are more commonly committed crimes such as drug trafficking, robbery or, even murder.
In conclusion, quitting daily activities that are done together is the initial step of falling apart for family members which inevitably leads to worse outcomes for the society like increased risk of crime and psychiatric problems.",,,,,,6.5,"The phenomenon of family members no longer regularly sharing meals together can be attributed to several modern trends, most notably the increasingly demanding work and school schedules that leave little time for communal activities. In the past, sit-down meals served as a central point of connection in daily life, but today, many people are required to stay late at work or attend extracurricular activities, making it difficult for everyone to be present at the same time. Additionally, the rise of individual electronic devices means that even when families are physically present, they may be mentally disengaged, choosing instead to eat separately while watching television or browsing their phones. From my perspective, this development has mostly negative impacts. Eating meals together is an important opportunity to strengthen family bonds, teach important social skills, and provide emotional support. When families stop sharing meals, children may feel isolated and parents may miss out on chances to guide and understand their children. I have observed that families who prioritize eating together tend to have better communication and a stronger sense of unity, while those who do not may struggle with misunderstandings and emotional distance. In conclusion, while modern life makes it harder for families to eat together, this trend poses significant risks to the cohesion and well-being of both families and society as a whole."
609,2,"Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Nowadays, with all the technology and studies involved in sports, it is very important the amount of strength and muscle develop that athletes must have, as much as, the mental training, to confront hard moments and be able to overcome. There are people who believe that physical strength is the key for success, on the contrary, others think that mental strength is most important for being successful. While muscle and physical preparation are the main reason to overcome on weaker opponents. Mental strength, in my perspective, is the most important because provides something special and unbreakable that last longer and gives more than just muscle power.
One the one hand, it is the physical strength. Which provides more energy for developing and performing better in sports, such as soccer, tennis, golf with better and precises strikes on the ball. Although, gives an important advantage on weaker opponents in therms of power, mobility and speed among others, for instance, boxing against a 20 pounds lighter fighter. In global, physical strength is a good and simple reason to overcome weaker athletes.
On the other hand, it is the phychological factor or “the head”. Which deliver more reciliense and will to win in stress and critic situations, like the final match in the last set of a grand slam. Also, good mental state allows to compensate the strengh, muscle and energy of opponents by focalizing the attention on last longer, that is the case of runners in marathon and ultramarathons. In the end, menthal power deliver something special, not measurable and unbreakable that last longer than just physical power.
In my opinion the most powerfull weapon that all athletes have is the mental strength, it is more powerful than any muscle, provides resilience to fatigue and focus in stressed times.
In summary, physical strength provides advantage on many aspects of sports, such as energy, velocity and movement. Nevertheless, mental strength is the key to succes in high quality sportsmans",,,,,,6.0,"There are many arguments about what is more important for success in sports: physical strength or mental strength. Some people believe that being physically strong is the key factor because it allows athletes to perform powerful moves, last longer in competition, and compete at a higher level, particularly in sports like rugby, basketball, and swimming, where muscle power and endurance are critical. For example, a weightlifter needs a strong body to lift heavy weights, and without enough physical strength, participation would not even be possible. However, other people consider mental strength more important because it helps athletes stay focused, manage pressure, and overcome setbacks during tough competition. In stressful moments, like taking a penalty kick in football or competing in the final minutes of a marathon, it is mental strength that helps athletes keep calm and perform at their best. Personally, I believe that while physical strength is necessary to reach a professional level in most sports, mental strength is even more important because it gives athletes the determination and confidence to push through challenges and achieve their goals. In conclusion, a combination of both physical and mental strength is necessary for success, but mental strength, in my opinion, plays a bigger role in helping athletes succeed in the long run."
611,2,"Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Champions have been heralded across cultures and religions for centuries. Hercules from Greek mythology and Samson from the Bible were known for their strength. Hermes, the messenger of the Greek gods adorned winged sandals to grant him the speed of wind. From ancient to current times, champions have shared their skills via sports. But a question has arisen. What takes presedence, brain or brawn?
For those who believe that physical strength is important for success in sport, we must consider the effort put into performing said activities. Running a marathon is easier said than done! Raising over 500kg above your head doesn't happen overnight, or rowing in appealing synchronization without training. Athletes train in gyms for countless hours by running on treadmills, strength training and doing plyometrics to develop the power in order to effectively perform their respective sports, thus proving the importance of physical strength to prevail in sports.
Others believe that in order to distinguish between the average and the greats, mental strength is the factor that does so. The amount of discipline, perserverance and other psychological strengths allow athletes to set world records. Former world's strong man, Eddie Hall has stated that he had used techniques from psychologists to unlock parts of the brain that provide super strength similar to that people use in life threatening situations to lift cars to save their children. He was able to become the first man to deadlift over 500kg. Though not as extreme, sportsmen and women must apply some form of mental strength to push themselves to achieve record-level excellence in sports.
I believe that brain and brawn harmoniously work together to create exceptional champions in sports. Physical strength is the baseline that allows athletes to perform their skills with endurance, and mental strength is the value needed to push them to go one step ahead of their competition. Sportmen must be able to run, lift, or even row without issue, as well as try, try, and try again, working through limiting beliefs so that they can become apart of sporting history.",,,,,,8.5,"Throughout history, sports have celebrated feats of both physical prowess and remarkable mental resilience. Many people argue that physical strength is the cornerstone of athletic achievement, pointing out that nearly every sport requires a degree of muscular ability, agility, or endurance in order to succeed. Whether in sprinting, wrestling, or swimming, athletes must condition their bodies rigorously, undergo strict training regimes, and strive to break their physical limits, demonstrating that strength and fitness are essential building blocks for reaching the top. Yet, there is another camp that believes mental strength is what sets elite athletes apart from the rest. The ability to manage pressure, bounce back after setbacks, and maintain relentless focus during competition are all cited as crucial psychological traits needed for victory. For example, a tennis player facing match points must dig deep mentally, remaining calm under stress and believing in their ability to turn the game around. After considering both perspectives, I am convinced that true success in sports requires a combination of both elements. Physical strength provides the foundation for competitiveness, while mental toughness enables athletes to sustain their efforts and overcome obstacles; together, they form an unbreakable partnership that leads to sporting greatness."
613,2,"Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It is often argued out there about sports, debating about both physcial and mental strengths and which is far more crucial to the success. This essay will go over these two points of view in further depth and outline some expamples, where relevant, for each.
On one side, some people think that the most important factor to succeeding in sports is the physical strength. Body strength is actually quite indispensable in any sport activity, especially those types of sports that demand a high fitness level and high physical endurance, etc, such as MMA fights, wrestling, football, and so on. All of these require an elevated and advanced charachterestics of one's body. For example, an athlete can not keep up a football match and running around for 90 minutes without a high body endurance, fitness, so on and so forth.
On the other hand, the others believe that a powerful mentality and mindset are needed for such success and accomplishment. That is, they believe that one's attitude is the first key to success before anything else. People need to have some sort of a mindset with specific qualities, such as perseverance, determination, concentration, etc. and it's not always about havign a massive body strength. For example, some MMA athletes step in the ring with solid bodies, will not always win the games if they're not determined and persistent already, altought their opponents do not have that huge bodies. It's all about the mindset.
In conclusion, it's not easy to decide which of these two criteria is more important than the other. However, I believe that any athlete must have these two, train them both before getting into any challenge, no matter what type of activity. An athlete must have a strong body and a trained attitude once and for all.",,,,,,6.5,"There is an ongoing discussion in the realm of sports about whether physical or mental strength leads to greater success. Both aspects have their own advantages, and it is worthwhile to examine them closely. From one perspective, physical strength is regarded as essential, especially in sports that are demanding when it comes to power, speed, and endurance. For instance, Olympic sprinters need explosive muscles to run at high speeds, and rugby players must have powerful bodies to tackle opponents and last the entire game. Without sufficient physical capabilities, it would be very hard for an athlete to compete at the highest level. However, there are many who argue that mental strength is actually more significant, as it involves resilience, focus, and handling pressure during crucial moments. Tennis players, for example, often face tough situations, like being match point down, and only those who stay calm and determined can turn the game around. Even the most physically skilled athletes might fail if they cannot overcome mental obstacles, such as fear of losing. In my opinion, while both physical and mental strength are necessary for sporting excellence, mental toughness makes a bigger difference. This is because the body can be trained to a point, but the ability to stay motivated and to push through setbacks is what separates good athletes from great ones."
615,2,"Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. This essay will discuss both these views with examples and show that while some people esteem physical strength, it is important to think of mental stretgth as a companion of physical strength which give any person in sports agility and flexibility.
Physical strength has been supported by many people as an important factor for success in sport. Those who think that physical strength is more important believe that it is a person's physique that is required to win any sport. For instance, in a study conducted by the Australisn National Team among sport fanatics in Perth, 80% of participants stated that physical strength was everything that any person involved in any kind of sport required to be succesful. Some participants in this study cited soccer as one such sport requiring physical strength. These findings were supported by another study conducted by a PhD student at the University of Sydney. The student concluded that while mental strength was important in any physically inclined sport, it was difficult to measure brain resources recquired to engage in sports like running.
On the other hand, some people think that mental strength gives stamina and agility to any person involved in sports. One prominent argument in this school of thought is that the body is a slave of the mind. Every action taken by the body is a response to the triggers initiated in the mind. Therefore, nourishing and strengthening mental capacity translates to physical strength. In a research study conducted among college students in America, it was found that mental strength was more esteemed than physical strength. It was argued in this study that mental strength was the breath that gave life to physical strength.
In conclusion, it can be argued that the reality of both mental and physical strength and their role in supporting a succesful sports career is not painted in black and white. A physically strong person needs to use their mental strength to plan and outwit their opponent. They also need tact and flexibility of the body which stem from the coordination between the body and the mind. As such, both mental and physical strength are important in supporting a successful sports career.",,,,,,7.5,"There is an ongoing debate about whether physical strength or mental strength is more crucial for success in sports. Some individuals strongly believe that physical strength plays the central role, as many sports such as weightlifting, football, or swimming demand high levels of power and endurance, which can only be developed by rigorous training and a robust physique. They point to examples of athletes who have excelled mainly due to their powerful bodies, claiming that without adequate physical preparation, it is almost impossible to compete at elite levels. However, others stress the significance of mental strength, arguing that focus, determination, and resilience are what truly set champions apart from the rest. Mental toughness is essential for overcoming setbacks, managing pressure, and staying motivated through challenging times. For example, marathon runners and tennis players often rely heavily on their mental discipline to push through fatigue and maintain concentration during critical moments of competition. In my opinion, while both aspects are important, mental strength provides the foundation for consistent progress and peak performance, because even the most physically capable athlete can falter without the right mindset. Therefore, a combination of both physical and mental strength is necessary, but mental fortitude may often be the deciding factor between victory and defeat."

For example, a football player practices every day so his muscles and skills develop, leading to more chances to win. However, mental strength is also important for athletes because sports can be stressful and sometimes they may lose or face problems during a match. If a player has a strong mind, he or she will not give up easily after failing and can stay focused on playing well even under pressure.

621,2,The use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among many people in society. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"The use of social media nowadays is widespread around the world. As the use of new techonology grows, people concern about what will be impact of this change. Some people argue the use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among people, which will lead to negative impacts on the society. Whereas, Others claim that the benefits from the use of social media outweigh the negative impacts. Which one is true? I will compare these two perspectives and state my opinion in this essay.
There is no denying that the use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction to some extent. People use social media to connect with other people. This kind of behaviors decrease the aspiration of real life interaction. However, using social media can not give the same feeling as a face-to-face interation. There is lack of intimacy and empathy. For this reason, it is easy to fall in lonelyness while occupied in social media.
However, sometimes the use of social media assists the interactions in real life. For example, friends who are far away from each other can interact in social medias. This helps to keep their relationship which can lead to a face-to-face interaction in the future. Moreover, some people even find out their lover through social medias.
In my opinion, the argument that the use of social media will replace face-to-face interaction is a little bit exaggerated. After all, most people use social media to assist their real life relationship, not to completely replace their face-to-face interactions with online chattings. The use of social media might replace some portion of face-to-face interaction, but in most cases, it will help us to connect with other people, and promote our real life interactions.",,,,,,6.0,"Today, social media has become a major part of daily life, changing the way people communicate and build relationships. Some people believe that social media is replacing face-to-face interaction, and they worry about the effects this shift may have on society. On one hand, there are disadvantages to relying on social media too much. It can make people feel isolated or misunderstood, since communicating online can lack emotional connection and lead to misunderstandings. People might spend so much time online that they miss out on real-life meetings, which are important for developing social skills and deeper bonds. On the other hand, there are clear advantages to social media as well. It makes it easy to stay in touch with friends and family, no matter how far away they live. Social media can help people find like-minded communities, share important information quickly, and even meet new friends they may not have met otherwise. In my opinion, while there are some negative consequences from using social media instead of face-to-face interaction, the benefits provided by easier communication and the ability to keep relationships active across distances are quite significant. Therefore, I believe the advantages of social media still outweigh its disadvantages, especially when people use it wisely to support their real-life connections rather than replace them."
623,2,The use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among many people in society. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"The modern world of social interaction changed completely over the past decades. Now many of us spent much more time interracting through social media, messengers for private or corporate messaging. We also use video conference and sharing our workflow remotely.
As for me we have different needs satisfied by communication formed by different systems in our brain. On the one hand we have we communicate with each other aiming to get a useful information. On the other hand communication gives some non-verbal part like a sense of neing involved into one process, belonging to a circle of friends, collegues or family. These two sides of the process of communication are implemented differently that's why each part gets its own advantages and disadvantages thanks to changing integrating new social network technologies.
If to talk about an information exchange - as for it became much more efficient with using messages, cloud storages and different coworking tools. But it is true only for those people who use these technology well. As far as I can see many advantages in remote work such as possibility not to waste time for commuting, offices and separate equipment, many people notice that their remote collegues disapperar often and avoid their duties. Some people couldn't concentrate while working at home. As for me people who experince such a problems are just addicted to strong stimules such as face-to face interraction and being managed by their boss. At the same time different internet based tools allow you to share much more information much faster and forever. Now you cannot just forget you task because you can always revise it in your work messenger and cloud folder wherever and whenever you are.
One another need - is to have a social interraction. Of course ssocial network give us some advantage even in this area - now we can keep our relationships with more people across longer distances. While moving to another city or country we do not feel isolation so much anymore. It allows us to mentain or ralationships longer and stronger. At the same time such an option give people a possibility to avoid face-to-face communication with people phisically close to them. As for me it gives only one disadvantage - it is getting harder to load some parts of our brain which are evolutionary oriented to face-to-face interraction.
I can conclude that social media interraction gave us some new possibilities and cut off some of the old ones. At the same time modern technologies blur boundaries between a real conversation and internet communication. Now we can perfectly see and hear each-other and even support financially. There are also some devises wich allow you to feel even more - like touches or heartrythm of each other. I think that new social media tools and some next directions of these tools will satisfy our face-to-face communication needs more and more over time.",,,,,,5.0,"Nowadays, social media is rapidly transforming the way we communicate with each other, often taking the place of traditional face-to-face meetings. While there are many benefits to this shift, such as being able to connect with people who live far away and staying updated on friends’ lives, there are also some real drawbacks that should not be overlooked. On one hand, communicating online is very convenient, saving time and allowing people to multitask, which makes it possible to keep in touch with a larger number of friends and relatives than would be possible in person. Furthermore, social media helps people find support and build communities, particularly for those who might otherwise feel isolated due to distance, health issues, or social anxiety. On the other hand, the lack of non-verbal cues and body language in online messaging often leads to misunderstandings or a sense of loneliness, as interactions can feel less genuine or emotionally satisfying compared to meeting in person. Some people also become so accustomed to communicating behind a screen that they start feeling nervous or awkward in real-world settings, which can harm their confidence and social skills. Overall, while the advantages of using social media are significant in terms of convenience and the ability to maintain connections across long distances, I think the disadvantages—like reduced emotional closeness and weakened face-to-face communication skills—are just as important. Therefore, I think the best approach is to use social media as a tool to supplement, but not completely replace, direct human interaction, so we don’t lose the valuable benefits of real-life conversations."

Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"In recent years, technology has been coming a long way and result in large convenience in our society. Especially, social media is a great sample of our lifestyle that drastically changed, compared with a few decades ago. I believe the advantages will outweigh the disadvantages to some extent.
Initially, it is clear that peoples' communication tool immensely changed due to social media. For example, the name of social media, ""Club House"" allows people to communicate globally. This means that those who are interested in improving their language skill or other specific hobbies. Furthermore, people are able to have a consultation with people around the world about their conserns of their lifestyle and mental issues that used to be confidential to their family, or friends face-to-face. These advantages let people expand their insights. Moreover, in business scenes, people frequently tap into some other communication tools, like Skype, Microsoft teams, and Zoom meetings. This social media is much helpful to work regardless of time, and place so that people can work with other country's colleagues. This is more profitable to make a sales figure smoothly because they can make more strategies because of these tools.
On the other hand, there might be some disadvantages. For instance, some people warn that people tend to be deluded because of innumerable information on social media. This means that they face some fake news and fraud. In addition, people would like to spend with friends, family, and strangers in person as a human instinct. Therefore, it necessarily recoups their lonliness by taking advantage of social media because they unconsciously hope to spend a good time in person, more than in blind conversation.
Finally, there is no doubt that social media and advanced technology provide a lot of options than before. This innovation will allow us to communicate and exchange with a lot of people across the globe. It is inevitable to improve and people need to get along with them. As a result, our lifestyle will lead to more convenience.

Many people now prefer using platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter rather than meeting face-to-face. I believe that the advantages of this trend can outweigh the disadvantages, but it depends on how social media is used. To begin with, social media makes it easier to stay in touch with friends and family, no matter how far apart they are. People can share photos, send messages instantly, and even have video calls, which helps them feel connected. It also allows people to meet new friends with similar interests and learn about different cultures by joining global communities. For example, students can find study groups and people with hobbies online. Additionally, social media has benefits for work and business, since communicating online saves time and lets people work from home or anywhere else. However, there are some negative aspects too. Some people may feel lonely or isolated when they substitute online friendships for in-person ones, and there is a risk of internet addiction. Also, not everything on social media is true, so people can become confused by rumors or false information. Despite these concerns, I think that the advantages of social media are more significant, especially when users are careful and balance their online time with real-life meetings. In conclusion, social media has created a new style of communication that can make life easier and more exciting, as long as people use it wisely and still try to meet others face-to-face when possible."

To start, sugar is the main component of this beverage. Study shows that consuming this can boost a person's energy levels. Hence athelete ae addicted to this refreshments such as energy drinks. Furthermore, this can increase mental alertness especially to working individuals.

Not only that, advertisement can also be a factor. For example, young people gets curious whenever new sugared drinks is advertised especially if this is shown by their favorite icon. Lastly, consumer's lack of knowledge and misinformation regarding their product as evident by the coca cola lawsuit.

Meaning high price can discourage them to buy this drinks. Second, just like alcohol, buying sugar-based drinks at malls or grocery store should have time limit. For instance, whoever will buy and sell beyond the allotted time should pay a fine. Also, Educating the public about the health issue of drinking too much sugar-based drinks should be prioritize. Finally, government should encourage company such as pepsiCo, and the Coca-cola company to be transparent of their nutritional facts.

One reason behind this trend is the easy access to these drinks, as they are sold everywhere from vending machines to convenience stores. Additionally, many people enjoy the taste and instant satisfaction that sugary drinks provide, especially when compared to plain water. Advertising also plays a large role, as companies constantly market these products as fun and energizing, often using celebrities to persuade young people. Social situations, such as parties and gatherings, can further encourage sugary drink consumption. To reduce the intake of sugar-based drinks, governments can introduce higher taxes on these beverages, making them less affordable. Schools and workplaces could provide healthier drink options and limit the sale of sugary drinks. Public health campaigns should also focus on educating individuals about the specific dangers of excessive sugar consumption, including obesity and diabetes. With combined efforts from authorities, communities, and families, it is possible to help people make healthier choices and decrease their dependence on sugar-based drinks."

Companies often add more sugar to improve flavor, so people naturally crave these drinks. Secondly, sugar-based drinks are easy to find and buy in most stores, and the prices are usually reasonable, which increases their popularity, especially among students and office workers who want a quick energy boost. However, drinking too many sugary beverages can be harmful to health, leading to problems like obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay. To reduce the number of people drinking these unhealthy drinks, the government can create more advertisements and campaigns about the dangers of consuming too much sugar. Also, placing a higher tax on sugary drinks or putting limits on how they are promoted to young people might help. Finally, individuals must try to choose water or healthier options instead, and develop good habits such as reading ingredients before buying drinks.

637,2,Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people argue that individuals can't do nothing to resolve the environmental problems of our times. Personaly, I partially disagree with this statement and in this essay I will go through some of the arguments that back my opinion.
On one hand, I have to agree with this statement. Many of the environmental problems that we are currently facing are caused by large companies and not by individuals. Whether it's pollution, deforestation or contamination, the indivual doesn't have as much impact as these entities have. Therefore, governements should take care of the problem rather than passing into the current citizen. In addition, the solutions that are needed to take place require an important political and economical influence. Only the governments are available to put in place the measures needed to counter-balance this situation.
On the other hand, waiting to be saved by the governments and institutions is not the right attitude. Individuals, while not having the same impact, can spark the change that is needed in order to take care of this problem. Not only that but citizens can make their contribution by applying some small measures than by itselfs aren't noticeable but when summed up can have a positive impact. For example, recycling their food waste or using ecological friendly products are habits that we can all do. If only one person does it, it won't have any effect, but it does when it's done by one million,
In conclusion, it can be said that both sides are needed in order to make a positive change on the current situation. This can start from the individual to then put in motion a bigger change.",,,,,,7.0,"There is a common belief that only governments and big companies have the ability to fix environmental issues, and that individual actions are pointless. Personally, I disagree with this viewpoint to some extent and will discuss my reasons in this essay. On the one hand, it is true that large-scale changes often need the power and resources of corporations and governments, since they can pass laws and fund projects that make a significant difference in pollution and conservation. Problems like air pollution or industrial waste are so massive that single people cannot stop them alone, so strong policies from those in authority are important. On the other hand, I believe individuals still play an important role in protecting the environment. People can change their daily habits, such as reducing plastic use, saving energy, or walking instead of driving. If millions of individuals make small improvements, the overall effect can be quite large. Besides this, citizens can influence companies and the government by voting or supporting green products, so their voices matter in the bigger picture. In summary, while governments and businesses have greater power, individuals should not be discouraged because their actions add up and can inspire larger changes too."
639,2,Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Individuals, who are willing to develop the environment are quite limited. Some people say it is almost nothing they can do. Therefore, governments and large companies need to improve the environment and it must be a large impact for society. I strongly disagree this opinion, because individuals also make a difference for the environment to some extent.
Initially, there is no doubt that governments, large companies and organizations have a large initiative to change the environment. For example, in Europe, especially in Germany, they are planning to make some restrictions on car industries not to manufacture cars which consume only petrol as energy in near future. Therefore, even in some sports car companies started releasing a new type of car which take advantage of electricity, which is a sustainable resource. Therefore, governments and companies control peoples' lifestyle.
On the other hand, people have already become aware of dangerous environment they are on the line. Therefore, many people voluntarily started to pick up garbage on the street and seaside. They also purchase sustainable bottles, instead of tapping into plastic bottles. In addition, technology has advanced in a few decades, and some influencers on the internet warn about issues of the environment. This means that individuals regardless of generation start to make some communities on social media and hold some events. For example, they discuss what they can do in their daily routine to reduce the consumerism, and which materials are realistically sustainable stuff in our lifestyle. As a result, some people start to establish a company geared towards eco-friendly company. For example, some companies launched the project to manufacture the solar panel and make strategies on how to spread them around the world as a sustainable and renewable resource.
Finally, of course, large companies and governments have a large power to control
the environment more beautifully. On the other hand, these organizations also configured by individuals. Therefore, governments need to add an environment subject in the curriculum at school. Consequently, more people start to consider on how to improve the environment in a large organization, the more people will suggest and make specific plans individually. If the ideas were rejected, they can post these ideas on the internet and people will come together to make a specific project.
In conclusion, individuals can do a lot of options by taking advantage of the internet and the influences are getting larger.",,,,,,6.5,"It is often said that individual actions make almost no difference when it comes to improving the environment, leaving the responsibility to governments and large corporations. I do not fully agree with this idea, as I believe that everyone has a role to play in protecting our planet. Indeed, it is true that major decisions, like banning certain pollutants or enforcing strict environmental laws, come from those in power. For example, government policies can encourage the use of renewable energy or reduce single-use plastics, which can have far-reaching positive effects. Large companies also have the resources to develop greener technologies and improve production processes. However, these efforts would not be successful without the cooperation of ordinary people. Many individuals already make changes in their daily lives by recycling, saving energy, and choosing eco-friendly products. Additionally, people often come together to form community groups that organize clean-ups or spread awareness about environmental problems. These small actions, when multiplied by millions, can lead to significant changes in attitudes and behaviors. In fact, consumer demand directly affects which goods companies choose to produce, so if more people buy sustainable products, companies will be encouraged to prioritize the environment. In conclusion, while governments and businesses have a big influence, individuals can and do make important contributions to improving the environment."
641,2,Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is no doubt these days that the action of the individual is not powerful enough to make the environment better. Unless through laws created by the government and activities have been taken by companies that have a high impact. I strongly disagree with this idea. because there are other ways to help the government as an individual.
In essay will prove my point with reasons and examples.
Nowadays, people can use social media as a platform that has the power to tell people around the world how to behave. Therefore, an individual has the power to convince others to give higher attention to our environment and create a community that has specific goals to improve. For example, social media influencers could educate the volunteer and work with the youth to make the environment better. For instance, show the young people how to sort the waste and how dangerous the impact is if they do not act in such as way.
Moreover, as individuals, people can start doing many actions which benefit the environment by themselves without obstructions. On the other hand, the government and companies should be aware too. For example, while the companies use the factories the government must be monitoring the discharge of fule.
In conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view, in my opinion, it is not necessary to wait for the government and the big companies to act activity for the environment because we as individuals can create and provide educational activities for the public to preserve the environment for the next generation.",,,,,,7.0,"It is commonly believed nowadays that only governments and major corporations hold the ability to improve the environment, and that the efforts of ordinary citizens are too small to matter. However, I completely disagree with this idea, since individual actions, when combined, can have a powerful impact on our surroundings. To begin with, each person can make everyday choices, such as recycling, saving water, or reducing plastic usage, that directly benefit the environment. For example, if millions of people choose public transport instead of driving their own cars, pollution would significantly decrease. In addition to that, individuals can participate in community clean-up projects or spread environmental awareness through local events and social media, motivating others to adopt eco-friendly habits. While it is true that governments and large organizations have the resources to implement broad policies and technologies to tackle environmental problems, this does not make individual responsibility any less important. In conclusion, after considering the evidence, I strongly believe that both personal and official efforts are necessary to protect our planet, and ordinary people should never underestimate their ability to make positive changes through daily actions and inspiring others."
643,2,"People often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen.What is your opinion about an ideal societyHow can we create an ideal society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is no doubt the truth that the majority of people want to live in a society where they can derive a sense of satisfaction. While people are ceaselessly struggling to improve society to meet their needs, there is almost always some problems or issues that remain and keep society from being better. In this essay, I try to examine the reason why it is a highly challenging and even impossible task to create an ideal society and give some measures that might be helpful to mitigate the situation.
The first step is to understand why the goal of an ideal society is tough to achieve. One of the most apparent reasons is that it is nearly not possible to give an explicit definition of ideality. Since the desire of each person can be extremely different and individual, their expectations of what an excellent society should look like are immensely varied and sometimes incompatible with each other. For instance, some people wish to have a society of fewer foreign immigrants because of the eventual rise in crime and the more intensive competitiveness in the job market, while others insist that a multicultural society certainly brings vast amounts of merits to the future. Another obvious reason is in terms of the difficulty of realizing the requirements. A prime example is eliminating discrimination against gender or sexual orientation. Although a lot of related laws have been introduced to protect the vulnerable population from being discriminated against, this issue remains one of the most significant concerns that people have and need to face every day.
Despite the complexity and challenges of creating the ideal society for everyone, there is still a large number of things that can be done to enhance the expectations of people toward the society where they live. In my opinion, an ideal society includes at least great tolerance. I believe that education, especially in primary school and kindergarten, plays an essential role in teaching how to treat others with respect, which benefits the tolerant atmosphere in society significantly. One measure that government should leastwise take into account is to fund the more meaningful projects at the school, which publicize and advocate the value of fairness, justice, and kindness.
To sum up, although it might not be possible to create a society that satisfies the whole population regarding the huge diversity of attitudes people hold toward the key consideration of an ideal society, there is still highly necessary to make every effort to make it a better one for all.",,,,,,8.0,"Most people dream of living in a perfect world where everyone gets along and life is comfortable, yet achieving such a society is a difficult task and perhaps impossible in reality. The main obstacle, in my view, rests in the diversity of human beings—each person has unique values, needs, and dreams, which makes it nearly impossible to find a definition of “ideal” that fits all. For instance, while some citizens may want strict laws for security, others might prioritize personal freedom and flexibility, causing conflict between their visions of a good society. Moreover, even when societies agree on the importance of fairness and justice, implementing these principles is challenging due to various economic, historical, or cultural differences. A good example is the persistent struggle for gender and racial equality worldwide; despite significant progress, discrimination still exists, often hidden or subtle. However, I believe progress toward a more ideal society can be made if people focus on mutual respect and understanding. Education is an essential tool in this process: when young people learn empathy, tolerance, and cooperation in school, they carry these traits into adulthood, helping reduce prejudice over time. Governments also have a role in supporting peaceful communities by investing in social programs, fair law enforcement, and inclusive policies. In conclusion, while a perfectly ideal society might be out of reach, consistent improvement is possible if individuals and leaders work together with open minds and a commitment to the common good."
645,2,"People often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen.What is your opinion about an ideal societyHow can we create an ideal society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","One of the ambition of the people is to create a harmonious community to live in. Unfortunately, individuals often fail to create one. This essay will discuss what is an ideal society, as well as ways on how to make it happen.
An ideal community is a place where peace of mind over shadows fear. We all now that everyone wants a place that is criminal free. For example, people can just walk in an aisle without thinking of being raped or kidnapped. Moreover, it is a community in which discrimination, prejudice and racism is prohibited. In short, everyone is treated equally regardless of gender, colors, religions, social status, jobs and looks. It also means that, people can just walk in and out of a hospital or establishments without being looked down or degraded by other people especially those with high status.
However, it is difficult for people to meet this kind of standards. This mainly because nobody is made perfect and as a human being we are mostly dominated by hatred, jealousy and selfishness. Although people fail to have a perfect society, there are some ways on how to have a near perfect place to live. First of all, government should make the lives of the people a better one by being an active role model to the citizens. There should not be corruption involve amongst the higher ups. Also, as what the saying goes ""learning should start at home"", it means that, parents should the take the initiative to educate their children proper manners in dealing with other people. In Japan, children were taught in a very young age on how to treat other people. That is why they always bow down their head as a sign of respect.
To conclude, creating an essential environment can be challenging and demanding for all of us. Eventhough, it is impossible to make, each one of us can has the capacity to contribute to make society an almost perfect one.",,,,,,6.0,"Throughout history, people have dreamed of making a society where everyone is happy, safe, and respected, yet building such a place has always been a challenge. In my view, an ideal society is where people help each other, live without fear, and have the freedom to become their best selves. For instance, a perfect community would make sure everyone has access to education, health care, and basic needs so no one is left behind. In addition, equality should be the norm, meaning that no one is judged or mistreated because of their race, background, or beliefs. Sadly, many societies do not reach these goals because of selfishness, prejudice, and a lack of understanding between people. However, there are steps we can take to move closer to this dream. Governments must set examples by being honest, fair, and caring, and should make laws that protect everyone equally. Also, teaching kindness and respect at home and in schools can help the next generation treat others better. For example, countries like Finland focus on fairness and community in their education and social programs, leading to happier citizens. To sum up, while making an ideal society is very difficult, with the right actions from both leaders and ordinary people, we can get closer to living in a better world together."

An ideal community is a place where peace of mind over shadows fear. We all now that everyone wants a place that is criminal free. For example, people can just walk in an aisle without thinking of being raped or kidnapped. Moreover, it is a community in which discrimination, prejudice and racism is prohibited. In short, everyone is treated equally regardless of gender, colors, religions, social status, jobs and looks. It also means that, people can just walk in and out of a hospital or establishments without being looked down or degraded by other people especially those with high status.
However, it is difficult for people to meet this kind of standards. This mainly because nobody is made perfect and as a human being we are mostly dominated by hatred, jealousy and selfishness. Although people fail to have a perfect society, there are some ways on how to have a near perfect place to live. First of all, government should make the lives of the people a better one by being an active role model to the citizens. There should not be corruption involve amongst the higher ups. Also, as what the saying goes ""learning should start at home"", it means that, parents should the take the initiative to educate their children proper manners in dealing with other people. In Japan, children were taught in a very young age on how to treat other people. That is why they always bow down their head as a sign of respect.
To conclude, creating an essential environment can be challenging and demanding for all of us. Eventhough, it is impossible to make, each one of us can has the capacity to contribute to make society an almost perfect one.",,,,,,6.0,"Everyone dreams of living in an ideal society where harmony and fairness are a normal way of life, but turning this dream into reality is often much harder than people expect. In my opinion, an ideal society is a place where everyone feels respected and safe, no matter their background or beliefs, and where people help each other rather than focus only on their own benefit. For instance, in such a society, people would not only follow the laws but also treat each other with kindness, and there would be very little crime or discrimination. However, building this kind of environment faces a lot of challenges because humans naturally have different opinions, and sometimes let their emotions, such as envy and anger, drive their actions. To move closer to an ideal society, I think education plays an important role. Parents and teachers should show children the importance of respect and sharing from a young age, like how some schools teach teamwork and honesty through group activities. Governments should also set a good example by being fair and not allowing corruption, because this shows people what is expected from everyone in the community. Even though perfection may be impossible, every small step towards kindness and justice helps us get closer to the society we want to create."
649,2,"People often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen.What is your opinion about an ideal societyHow can we create an ideal society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","An ideal society where people co-exist in perfect harmony and respect, regardless of race, beliefs, or gender, is a universally desired idea. Although striving for these ideals would benefit the individuals, I strongly believe that an ideal society can never be achieved because it’s unrealistic.
Striving for an ideal society would benefit the individuals because nobody can live better unless they learn to think better. To begin with, virtues such as courage, fairness, and respect are admirable character traits that everyone should try to pursue. If individuals can become better versions of themselves, then the whole community would surely become better. Moreover, different people will have different versions of an ideal society. Hence, encouraging people to actively and critically think about how they can lead better lives will lead to a more open-minded, robust, and tolerant community.
While it’s beneficial for individuals to work on self-improvement, an ideal society can never be created or maintained. Firstly, people are selfish and will pursue their self-interest at the expense of the group. If I can get ahead by taking more resources than my neighbor, then why shouldn’t I take more? Upon seeing me do that, others will envy and start taking more for themselves. Consequently, competition and discord within society are inevitable. Secondly, progress can’t be made unless stronger groups get ahead and wipe out less adaptable ones. Examples include factories replacing farming cultures and technology replacing manual labor.
In conclusion, although striving towards the ideals is beneficial to individuals within communities, the ideal society could never be achieved due to its impracticality. Schools, governments, and communities should nevertheless encourage people to actively think and work on becoming better versions of themselves.",,,,,,8.5,"The concept of an ideal society, where everyone lives peacefully and all problems are solved, is appealing yet extremely difficult to achieve in reality. In my view, an ideal society is one where fairness, security, and opportunity are available to all, but actually establishing such a society is almost impossible because of human nature and practical limitations. To start with, humans have different values, cultures, and ambitions, making it hard to reach agreement on what is truly ""ideal"" for everyone. For example, while some people may value personal freedom above all, others may prioritize social equality, and these differences can lead to conflicts and compromise the sense of harmony. Furthermore, even if rules and systems are designed to be fair, people may act out of self-interest, which can undermine collective efforts: for instance, individuals might use loopholes in laws meant to promote fairness for personal gain, creating new inequalities. Despite these barriers, it’s still worthwhile to try to move toward a better society by promoting education, tolerance, and empathy. An example from my own life is witnessing a community program where neighbors volunteered to help the less fortunate; though not perfect, such efforts showed that small actions could bring people closer to the ideal. In conclusion, while a perfect society may only exist in theory, working towards social improvement and mutual understanding can create a community that, though imperfect, reflects some of the ideals we value most."
651,2,"People often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen.What is your opinion about an ideal societyHow can we create an ideal society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays, in western civilization, there is a debate on people who think to create an ideal society but why they are not able to achieve this. In this essay, I will give my point of view of an ideal society and after I will explain the methods to create this society.
To begin with, from my experience and perspective, I believe that the ideal society is a place without criminals and serious offenders. A community without crime is a wonderful and safe place for our children and our families to live in harmony without rapes, thefts and murders. For example, in an isolated village outside a theme park in Canada, the locals lived with rules and culture without violence and crimes and everybody was happy and satisfied with their jobs and social life. Furthermore, the local community was very well balanced without arguments and conflicts because of the lack of serious offenders and criminals.
On the other hand, the creation of an ideal society is something very difficult. I honestly believe that the only way to build a balanced community is to educate our children because they are the future of this world and they need good examples and knowledge to create a good character. For instance in Ancient Athens, Greece local politicians and philosophers were responsible to educate the young people not only in school but also in the street or open theatres. As a result of this action, young people received knowledge and fundamentals to be ideal citizens of ancients Athens.
To conclude, from my point of view there is no place for crimes and offences in an ideal society because these will destroy the balance and the harmony of the people. Furthermore, proper education is the best way to help our children to build good characters and balanced lifestyles.",,,,,,7.0,"In my opinion, an ideal society is one where each person has equal chances, and everyone feels safe and respected. In the perfect community, no one suffers from hunger or homelessness, and all people support each other regardless of where they come from. However, making this happen is quite complex because humans have different desires and beliefs. The best way to build an ideal society, I believe, is through education and caring about others. For example, I remember my school organizing food drives and volunteering activities, which made our neighborhood a kinder place. If people everywhere learned to share and help rather than compete or fight, society would slowly become closer to ideal. Besides, good laws and leaders who listen to people's needs can also make a big difference. In conclusion, even if achieving a flawless community is challenging, by teaching children kindness and responsibility, and by acting with empathy, we can move closer to this goal."
653,2,Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?,"The topic of whether students should choose a specific specialized in limited subjects or all students need to study a wide range of subjects until they graduate school, has been discussed across the world, including in Japan. Although there are some benefits to the education system which specialize in some specific subject, I think to learn wide range of subjects until they leave school.
For example, there are some courses which focus on some specific industry in Japan. Specifically, it is geared toward hair stylists, IT programming, and entertainment. It is useful for them to learn the specific curriculums earlier might be advantageous to master these techniques. Especially, when it comes to entertainment, younger talented people tend to be evaluated higher than older talented people.
On the other hand, there are some benefits to learn a variety of subjects until they leave high school. For example, learning mathematics will allow us to boost some skills to predict and solve some issues logically. And learning English will be an essential tool to communicate with people worldwide. In addition, people have often required a variety of educational knowledge in daily conversation, especially in the workplace. This means that learning a wide range of subjects is helpful to bear out their variety of educational backgrounds.
Finally, it might be difficult for teenagers, especially fifteen years old students to decide which occupation, and industry they would like to work. Teenagers have often deluded and changed their idea about which occupation is suitable for them, however, they have some specific dreams in advance. Therefore, learning a wide range of subjects will be helpful to decide a variety of occupations in the future. This means that if students had learned a wide range of subjects until high school, it will be helpful to consider a long time and let them decide on a variety of job occupations. Then, they should choose the specific faculty they would like to learn at university.",,,,,,6.0,"The question of whether students should focus on a small number of subjects from age fifteen or continue learning a broad range of subjects until graduation has been widely debated in many countries. Specializing early has benefits, such as allowing students to deepen their skills and knowledge in areas they are passionate about or that are in high demand, such as engineering, nursing, or computer science. This focus can make them more competitive and ready for their chosen careers or further education. However, the system where students study many subjects until finishing school also has significant advantages. For example, by learning history, science, languages, and mathematics, students develop a more balanced understanding and become better at critical thinking and problem-solving. This wide education can be useful because many jobs require basic knowledge in various fields, and life itself often presents situations where general knowledge is necessary. Moreover, students at fifteen are usually still discovering their interests and strengths, so forcing them to decide too early could limit their options in the future. In my opinion, while specialization is important, it is better for students to continue studying a range of subjects until they are older, so they have more time to learn about themselves and make informed decisions about their futures."
655,2,Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?,"Education programs are different from one area to another area, there are systems that learners are required to choose restricted number of courses for their academic curriculum by the age of 15.while,other educational systems ask students to take comprehensive courses until they graduate from school. There are many positives for both trends, in my opinion limited range of academic subjects education system is better.
On the one hand, it is basic knowledge to accept the idea that pupils who study selected number of subjects from age of fifteen are more informative academically in specified field of study. For example, when student decide to take medical subjects from early age the student will be prepared by tutors completely for the nominated curriculum,as a result all the student's focus will be on medical topics thus, the student is more qualified to practice medicine more efficiently after school graduation.Furthermore, this system will build a solid knowledge background in limited range of subjects can help to develop creativity at early age.Moreover, in the financial view point it may be better for students to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15; selected number of academic subjects means less money allocated for educational services by guardians.
On the other hand, it is true to claim that general subjects system can prepare students to be more informative in various different live aspects. Since, students who register with wide range subjects system can gain academic knowledge and support in fields such as mathematics,physics,medicine,and....ect. Therefore,those students can select more than one speciality to practice as a professionalism in future.Besides, wide range system help to improve social interactions better,because friends will not be separated and they continue school education together until graduation,inaddition there is chance to make more friends as primises are more crowded.
To sum up, educational systems main target is to develop and progress academic background of students.But, in my opinion,it is better to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15 due to reasons like: solid academic background in specific field,creativity,and less financial burden on parents.",,,,,,7.0,"There are different ways that education systems organize the courses students take at school. Some countries have students focus on only a few subjects when they turn fifteen, while others ask students to keep taking many different classes until they finish school. Both approaches have certain advantages. Specializing early can help students who already know their interests to become experts in a subject, which means they can be better prepared for their future career or university studies. For example, someone who wants to be an engineer can spend more time on math and science and get a strong foundation in those areas. This may also reduce stress because students do not need to handle subjects that do not relate to their goals. On the other hand, learning a wide range of subjects gives students a broader general knowledge, which is useful if they change their mind about what they want to do. It can also help people adapt to different jobs or situations later in life. For instance, students who study art, history, and languages in addition to science will be more flexible and may discover new interests. In my view, while specializing has benefits for focused students, I believe it is better to continue with a wide variety of courses because most teenagers are still discovering what they like, and a broader education helps them keep more options open for the future."
657,2,Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?,"The is a common belief that students’ focus on selected subjects from secondary school is beneficial for their school results. However, it is a more persuasive argument that students studying a wide range of subjects throughout their school life is more applicable for their future.
On the one hand, studying a limited range of subjects from 15 years ago helps students to develop specific abilities. Once they decide on their stream of subjects such as art, science, or commerce, they will be focused on special training. This teaching method can help them to become a specialist or professionals. For instance, in China, over 500 business schools are opened to train students to become specialists in the business field. Students can apply to those schools when they turn 15. According to a statistic from one of the business schools, 70% of their students received high scores in the national exam.
Nevertheless, a wide range of subjects is more suitable for students to develop their intelligence. Students can student various knowledge from different aspects, they can choose the subject they are interested in most. Moreover, students can have a longer time to study before choosing their faculty at university. Numbers of basic knowledge and longer time to consider helping them make the best decision for themself. Students are motivated to do their best. For example, over 90% of students at the Norway University claimed that they are satisfied with studying all subjects before choosing a university. They have a full idea of what they like and dislike. They found that school life is excited and full of happiness.
To sum up, it is apparent that students can be well-developed in a specific subject with a limited range of choices, however, it is undeniable that a wide range of subject can develop their real interests.",,,,,,6.5,"Education systems differ around the world, with some requiring students to focus on a narrow range of subjects from the age of fifteen, while others encourage studying a broader curriculum. Specializing early can help students become highly skilled in a chosen field, as it allows them to dive deeper into subjects and gain practical expertise at a younger age. For example, in Germany, students select either an academic or vocational path by age fifteen, which often leads to better preparation for future careers and higher rates of employment in their chosen sector. However, requiring students to study a variety of subjects until they finish school also provides valuable benefits. This approach allows young people to explore different areas of knowledge and keeps their options open as they mature and understand their own interests and strengths. In countries like Canada, where students typically study multiple subjects through high school, graduates tend to be more adaptable and better prepared to face changing job markets. After considering both perspectives, I believe that a system encouraging students to learn a wide range of subjects until they leave school is better for their overall development. It helps them make more informed decisions about their futures and prepares them to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving world."
659,2,Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?,"Nowadays, due to a wide range of education methods and systems, there are a lot of opinion and debates for which being the best orientation for students. Some experts believe that it is good for pupil to only focus on a few subjects during their school life. However, some criticisms argue that the more subject students have, the more practical knowledge they can require. For me, both of such education systems might have different benefits for students as well as I prefer the latter rather than the former.
First of all, there may have some evidence for people to reckon the upsides of concentration on mainly subjects, Considering the fact that learning too many subjects can be very time-consuming and they may feel confused as well as overwhelmed when they gain a lot of knowledge at the same time. Given a circumstance, students who are studying in Hong Kong must take the DSE every year from the age of fifteen, the Hong Kong examination and Assessment Authority recommends students do not choose more than seven subjects during the exam. Result from having more practices as well as revisions as much as they can. Hence, if students would like to do a test, they could be more suitable to study the primary subjects.
Conversely, some criticisms considered that it is probably good for students to pick up variety of subjects in view of finding their interests and avoiding spoon feed information. Since many educators think that Hong Kong education system is too exam-oriented, this way could harm students mental and physical health. For instance, parents who are from Hong Kong complain about the education curriculums are too concentrated on spoon feed information rather than giving more life experience to students once in a while. That is why parents sometimes enjoy to choose various of study tours as well as extra curriculums for their children. Thus, some people tend to having more immersing the experience more than studying a few of subjects in their young age.
In summarize, it is hard to say which opinion would be the best since different types of education methods may have their advantages and disadvantages. On the other hand, personally, it is the key that pupils will never know what they can done until they tried. That is the reason why I prefer studying vary subjects in their young age than being an expert in the major part.",,,,,,5.0,"In today’s world, the education system that students attend can have a big impact on their future. Some countries encourage students to choose only a few subjects to specialize in starting from age fifteen, so they can focus deeply and become experts in just a couple of areas. Supporters of this system argue that by concentrating on fewer subjects, students can gain a much stronger understanding, and will be better prepared for jobs or degrees related to them. For example, a student who focuses mainly on math and science from an early age may easily enter a technical university later. On the other hand, some education systems require students to study a large number of subjects until graduation, which can help develop a more well-rounded knowledge of the world. People who like this way say that it lets students find out what they truly enjoy, since they might discover a hidden talent in history or art that they never knew about before. Additionally, learning many different topics can help students relate ideas from one subject to another, like understanding how science topics affect society or the economy. While both systems have clear benefits, I personally believe it is better for students to keep learning a wide range of subjects until they finish school, because this gives them more options for their future and helps them become creative and adaptable in life."
661,2,The typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"For many years, the traditional teaching and learning (T&L) approach, i.e., having a teacher disseminating knowledge to a group of students in a classroom, is dominent over the world.
With the advancement of information and communication technology, new learning approaches have been proposed and adopted. For example, students can now use computers to surf the internet to find information or knowledge they would like to study. Moreover, a number of pre-recorded education contents are now available online to provide classes/tutorials to learners. It is expected that this tradition T&L approach will not exist by 2050. Would it be true?
There is no doube that there is an increasing number of T&L approaches due to emergence of new technologies. Together with the new approaches, we see there is a shift of the role of teachers these years, not only as one who is responsible to disseminate knowledge, but also a faciliator of learning. Teachers provide proper directions to students during their study, where current technology is not able to offer. Some people say the artificial technology is a threat, but still the accuracy of providing suggestions to students is not very high. Moreover, human teachers are able to provide emotional support to students. Studying is not just a robotic process of human beings. Students may encounter difficulties during the learning process and feel frustrated, which will eventually affect their progression in study. Human teachers could be more aware on this situation, not by the numeric assessment results, but the emotional behaviour of the students in the classroom, and provide prompt and proper counselling support and advice to the students.
Also, it is still well-known that computers, even with AI, are weak in creating new knowledge. In the university setting, other than teaching the conventional knowledge, professors would disseminate their new research findings to the students in the class, with discussion among the students, inspiring them to the unexplored areas. This T&L process can only be effective when it happens in a classroom setting.
In conclusion, technology may alter the way how we teach and learn. In spite of this, human teachers are also adaptive and certain roles of the teachers cannot be replaced by other tools or machines. Therefore, I believe that the tradition classroom T&L setting cannot be replaced completedly in the future.",,,,,,8.0,"It is often argued that by the year 2050, the familiar classroom setup where a teacher instructs a group of students will become obsolete due to progress in technology and educational innovation. Indeed, recent years have witnessed a remarkable transformation in how students access information, with online courses, virtual reality environments, and interactive learning platforms becoming more widespread. However, despite these technological advancements, it seems unlikely that the traditional teacher-student classroom setting will entirely disappear. Teachers still play a crucial role not only in explaining complex concepts and guiding discussions, but also in motivating and supporting students on a personal level. While artificial intelligence and digital resources can deliver information quickly, they lack the ability to foster interpersonal relationships, adapt spontaneously to the emotional needs of learners, or encourage critical thinking through in-person debates and collaboration. Moreover, certain subjects and skills, such as scientific experiments or group problem-solving, are best taught in a physical classroom where hands-on engagement is possible. Therefore, although the integration of technology will continue to redefine education and provide new opportunities for individualized learning, I do not believe that the typical classroom experience with teachers and students will vanish entirely by 2050, as its irreplaceable benefits remain essential to effective learning."
663,2,Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?,"Councils are debating if building housing areas on expanded land is a better solution than providing taller dwellings. It might be an extremely complicated choice, considering the skyrocketing rise of number of people in the world and the change in prefering a walk-distance city. This essay will explore the optimal solutions for cities layout.
Although the ideal solution might depend on what the cities are aiming for, under a generic point of view, it would be optimal to have dwellings compacted in a dimished size of land. The first justification is that cramping everything in a reduced area and growing tall allowes all the residents to reach shops and workplaces in dwindling time through walking, public transport or eco-friendly vehicles. Moreover, taking in account the overall incresing of population's density, with the creation of a taller layout, a sustainable market demand will be shown.
Nowadays, the antiquated method of construct residences on a wider area of land is not feasible. In most locations, cities are running out of vacant lands, in fact many single houses are occupying vast areas for luxury amenities for a limited family, when a building can be erected accomodating many households. Furthermore, an implementation in infrustracture, such as roads and parking, will be needed. If individuals are not able to arrive to destination without a private car, due to long distances to cover, more highway will be required, therefore more lands is taken away for agglomerate of dwellings and business offices.
To conclude, the world is shifting toward a highly populated areas, so that councils need to keep up to date with convinient cities layout, like skyscrapers rather than single houses, to ease people lifestyles and reduced citizens' footprint.",,,,,,6.5,"When considering how to provide adequate housing in growing cities, decision-makers often choose between constructing taller apartment buildings or spreading houses over larger areas outside city centers. Each method offers certain benefits, but many factors suggest that building vertically is the better solution for most urban environments. One clear advantage is that taller buildings use land more efficiently, which is crucial as available space becomes scarce in popular cities. Vertical housing means more people can live near jobs, schools, and essential services without needing to rely heavily on private vehicles, which reduces traffic and air pollution. In contrast, spreading houses out into suburbs or the countryside consumes a vast amount of land and requires more infrastructure investment for roads, water, and electricity. This not only harms the environment but also increases costs for both the city and its residents. While some families might prefer the privacy and yard space of a single house, a compact city with high-rise apartments encourages community, convenience, and lower energy usage per resident. Overall, for cities facing swelling populations and limited land, developing taller buildings is the more practical and sustainable option to ensure everyone has access to affordable and accessible housing."
665,2,Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?,"Some big cities, especially in Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama in Japan tend to build taller buildings like skyscrapers. Other local cities and places where are scarcely populated are built wider. This is quite understandable in terms of space, and there might be some solutions to dissipate populations around Japan.
Initially, the main reason why people tend to gather in big cities is that there are many opportunities to get a job. There are famous headquarter companies and branches that are based in foreign countries. Therefore, more and more people move to the big cities so that many taller apartments and buildings are built to let them live in the limited space. There seems to be stressful due to people being densely populated, but infrastructures are well organized, especially transport, medical care, and security.
In contrast, the population in the countryside becomes less. Therefore, there is plenty of space to build houses in the wider area. It seems to be well-relaxed and comfortable to live in a slow-paced lifestyle. But, it is apparently more difficult to obtain a new job, and lacking transport, so they need to rely on cars. In addition, the number of hospitals is much smaller than big cities. These issues are long controversial as a first world problem.
Finally, as Covid-19 spread worldwide, many people are started to work at home with a lap top computer. Innumerable companies adopted IT systems that are able to work remotely. In addition, some companies had already stated this systemized working style will not change, however, Covid-19 completely ended. This means that many people do not necessarily need to live in big cities. Therefore, if the transport system is well organized, especially establishing and improving a train, which works faster and more frequently. This effort will be not only helpful to dissipate the population outside of the big cities, but also promotive to tackling with great infrastructures to countrysides.
In conclusion, as a result, the densely populated cities will be able to reduce its population and increase the population in the countryside. As a result, some issues will be resolved and become well-balanced solutions. Finally, it might be able to build wider houses in big cities with reasonable prices than now.",,,,,,5.5,"Some cities choose to build upwards with tall apartment buildings and skyscrapers to accommodate a growing number of residents in a limited space. These urban areas, such as New York or Hong Kong, benefit from this solution because land is scarce and expensive, and more people can live conveniently close to work, shops, and transportation hubs. Living in high-rise buildings often means people have better access to public services and infrastructure, but it can also lead to crowded environments and less privacy. On the other hand, some cities or suburbs prefer spreading out with houses built on larger plots of land. This method provides families with more freedom, private gardens, and quieter neighborhoods, which many people find appealing for raising children or enjoying a more relaxed lifestyle. However, wider housing development often leads to urban sprawl, longer travel distances, and heavier dependence on cars, which can cause environmental problems and make it harder to maintain efficient public services. In recent years, as more people can work remotely, there is a growing opportunity to balance these solutions. If towns invest in better transportation and internet infrastructure, people could enjoy the advantages of wider housing without sacrificing quality of life or connection to city services. In my opinion, the best approach is to combine both solutions, fostering taller buildings in city centers for those who need easy access to jobs and wider housing in less crowded areas, so that everyone can choose the lifestyle that suits them best."
667,2,Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?,"In my opinion, the two solutions both have its pros and cons. But I think the first solution which is, create housing areas by providing taller buildings, is a better solution. Providing taller buildings can save the area of lands being use and can create more areas with green grass or trees that can help the environment. Also taller buildings can provide greater view and can be designed in creative ways. So does the buildings in cities can create a skyline which makes the city scenario more modern and breathtaking. On the other hand, if we choose to build houses on a wider area, the land will still, be eventually out of use. And they are likely to destroy wildlife or nature areas since places that has wide areas are mostly at the rural parts of the country. Also, houses wide spread in a large area can be crowded and can seem messy and not ideal for site. Although maybe some people will think that shorter buildings are safer when there is a fire or when natural disasters like earthquake comes, but the number of times these problems occur are low and modern technology can also help to lower the risk of people getting hurt. In conclusion, I think create housing areas by providing taller buildings is a better solution because it solves the fundamental problem which is not having enough places for people to live by not using new lands and can also creates less harm for the nature, which is significantly important.",,,,,,5.5,"When comparing the two options for solving the housing problem in cities, I believe building taller buildings is the better solution. One of the main benefits of constructing taller buildings is that they use less land for the same amount of housing, which means we can protect more green space and natural habitats. Tall buildings can also make it easier for people to travel because more people live in one area, so public transportation is more efficient and useful. In addition to that, living in a tall building can offer good views, and the city looks more modern with interesting skylines. If we build houses spread out over a large area, we would need to use more land, which can harm the environment and make cities larger and more difficult to get around. Even though some people are worried that tall buildings could be dangerous in emergencies like earthquakes, new technology and building methods can make them much safer. For these reasons, I think providing taller buildings is a smarter and more sustainable way for cities to provide housing."
669,2,Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?,"In the modern society,it is seen that the buildings in the housing areas vary from one city to the other city where some cities prefer taller buildings and other cities prefer smaller buildings on a wide land.
This essay illustrates the reason why they are built in this way and compares the advantages and disadvantages of each type of building.
It is often said that the taller buildings are ideal for houses in metropolitan cities.The main reasons are the cost of land and a very large population in big cities.As a solution for this problem,people in big cities prefer taller buildings where the homes are easily affordable for them.However,this leads to over crowding and lack of adequate ventilation.For instance,in Mumbai,the largest city in India,the cost of land and the population is so high that the majority of the constuction companies build taller buildings in order to solve this problem.
In contrast,some cities with a lower population and comparatively lower cost of land build shorter buildings on a wide land.This enables cities to prevent over crowding in communities and have a wider open area with greenery providing a lot of ventilation helping people to lead a better life style.For example,in Chandigarh,a union territory in India,the construction of houses are perfectly executed providing enough space between each house as the cost of land and the population is relatively low when compared to cities like Mumbai.
To summarise,some cities with high cost of land and the high population prefer taller buildings lacking adequate ventilation and leading to overcrowding where as the in the cities with the opposite situation ,the houses are built on a larger piece of land providing adequate space between each house.",,,,,,8.5,"In cities around the world, the way housing is developed can depend greatly on the factors such as population density, land cost, and available space. Some cities choose to build tall apartment buildings, stacking many homes in a small land area, while others spread out and fill larger plots of land with individual homes. Choosing taller buildings is a common solution for overpopulated and land-scarce cities because it maximizes the number of residents who can live comfortably in limited space, which also helps control housing prices. However, this leads to certain drawbacks, such as less access to green spaces, less privacy, and the possibility of crowded living environments. On the other hand, cities with ample land and fewer residents can afford to build houses that are spaced farther apart. This approach promotes a higher quality of life, as people can enjoy gardens, parks, and more personal space, but it also has its downsides, including greater distances to travel for work or services and higher infrastructure costs. In conclusion, while building upwards is often better for large, busy cities to solve space and cost problems, spreading out houses works well in smaller or less populated areas where land is not as valuable and people seek a quieter lifestyle."
671,2,"In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","I strongly agree with this statement. If women and men are both working full time, they should share household works.
First of all, if women and men are working full time, and they are working in the same amount of time, logically, the amount of time they do household works should be the sam e. However, if one of them work for longer hours, the household works should still be shared but the other one should do more household works.
Second of all, everyone have responsibility to do household works because everyone lives in the house, makes the house dirty, creates dirty clothes and dishes. If there is only either women or men doing household works, it is not fair at all, because they both work full time.
But as I mentioned before, the amount of time doing household works can be arranged, it doesn't have to be evenly shared. For instance, if the woman in this family work for longer hours or got an extra call by work, the man should help and do her part of household works. And when the man are working more, the woman should do the same. This does not only solve the problem of who should do household works but can also show that women and men are supporting each other in various situations.
In conclusion, when women and men are both doing full time jobs, they should share household works. But it doesn't have to to be split in two halves, it can have alternatives depending on the working hours or special situations. In this way, the house can be more peaceful and have more harmony without arguments about who should do the household works.",,,,,,5.5,"In my opinion, I completely agree that women and men should share household works if both are working full time. To begin with, when both partners have jobs, they both come home tired and still need to manage things at home, so it would be unfair if only one person had to do all of the chores. Sharing the housework means the responsibility is balanced, and it helps prevent one partner from feeling exhausted or taken for granted. Also, household work is something that benefits everyone living in the home, not just one person, so it makes sense that everyone helps out. In some situations, maybe one person’s job is more demanding or they work longer hours, so the other person could do more chores on those days, but overall it should still be a team effort. If men and women divide the tasks, it shows respect and support for each other, which can strengthen their relationship. In conclusion, since both are working full time, it is logical and fair that household tasks are shared in a flexible and considerate way, making home life more comfortable for everyone."
673,2,"In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is becoming a trend now that husbands and wives should handle the household works together since both members of the family are working full time. In my opinion, it is convincing that the house tasks should be equally spread between both genders for the following reasons.
In many developing countries, people are required to work more than before; as a result, both genders are having busy lives nowadays and cannot handle the works of the house by only one of them. If the chores are being handled by both men and women, it increases the other partner's satisfaction and shows responsibilty. For instance, if a wife has several tasks in the kitchen to finish before heading to work and her husband helped their children to get ready for school, this emotionally affects the wife and she will eventually feel gratification.
Secondly, as technology evolves, people are having a hard time to manage the tasks of their homes and might eventually hire a nanny to take care of the children and home. As a result, children would feel loneliness in addition to being ignored by their parents. Although it is not easy to manage the work life and family at the same time, giving priority to one before the other can be counter-productive. Finally, as both partners work together to handle household work, it will eventually lead to a balanced life, their daily schedules will be organised; moreover, they will have more time to spend with their children thus, the home will not have problems as long as the mother and the father are working together to manage their home.
By way of conclusion, I would like to re-affirm there is a vital role for both males and females in order to keep their homes well balanced. Despite having a full employement job for both of them, it is necessary to share the works of their home together.",,,,,,7.0,"In today's society, it is common for both men and women to have demanding careers outside the home, which makes it sensible for them to share responsibilities within the household as well. I strongly agree that dividing housework equally between partners is crucial in these circumstances for a number of reasons. Firstly, when both individuals contribute to household chores, it not only reduces the pressure on one person but also fosters a sense of partnership and respect between spouses. For example, if both a husband and a wife return home tired from work and each does their part, such as cooking, cleaning, or assisting children with homework, they are more likely to feel appreciated and maintain a harmonious relationship. Secondly, evenly distributing household duties sets a positive example for children, teaching them about equality and cooperation from a young age. In addition, sharing tasks can help prevent burnout and allow both partners to have free time for leisure or to pursue their personal interests. Some may argue that traditional roles should be maintained, but as society evolves, it becomes evident that equality within the home leads to greater happiness and strengthens family bonds. In conclusion, I believe that in families where both partners work full time, sharing household responsibilities is a logical and beneficial practice that supports mutual respect and a balanced family life."
675,2,"In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is believed that in several nations Ladies and Gentlemen should help each other in domestic duties owned to the fact that both are fully employed. Personally, I strongly consent the view due to the fact that none of them is superior to other. This essay will explore the foremost motives reflecting this and provide evidence to prove the arguments.
There are manifold reasons for home activities division. First and foremost, equality of gender. In modern socities either Ladies nor Men is better than other. For this reason, once both are integral workers, they should divide domestic activities. Moreover, the one who come first at home should task without any prejudice. Let's take the couple Ronaldo, although they are famous one as well as wealthy personalities, they help each other in meals cooking. Hence, the couple is happy and stable.
Other reason for household sharing activities is in light of women empowering. In the contemporary times, mandams should be treated equally as Sirs so that society could be free of chauvinism. For instance, in a number of African regions girls still regarded as inferior by their husbands. As a result, human rights are constantly violated which undoubtedly undermine their live's style and personality.
In conclusion, couple of genders should obviously share the household occupations because both have the same rights as well as occupations. Therefore, I strongly agree with the stand that both can do the dishes without any hesitation. Furthermore, they should make a week blueprint to the best duties management.",,,,,,6.0,"In many societies today, both women and men pursue full-time careers outside the home, leading to the question of how domestic chores should be distributed. I firmly agree that it is logical and fair for both genders to share household work equally. Firstly, with both partners working similar hours, it would be unreasonable for one person, often women in traditional settings, to take on the majority of tasks at home. Sharing responsibilities not only respects the value of each individual's time and effort but also fosters mutual understanding and partnership within relationships. For example, in numerous homes where chores are divided, couples report feeling more satisfied and supported, which leads to stronger family bonds. Furthermore, splitting household duties sets a positive model for children, teaching them about equality and cooperation regardless of gender. In conclusion, distributing domestic tasks among both women and men recognises the realities of modern life and promotes fairness, so I strongly believe both should participate in housework for a balanced and harmonious home."
677,2,"In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In many parts of the world, both men and women are full-time employees, which has led to the trend of shared household chores for both genders. In my opinion, this shift should be encouraged to reduce inequality issues while it also benefits family relationship.
First, sharing housework is reasonable because it will enhance gender equality, which is a worrying problem in many societies. In the past, it was widely believed that women were solely responsible for household works since women have the distinctive characteristics of care and neatness. This has resulted in many women in many countries, particularly in Asia, under pressure and engendering a sense of resentment regarding overwhelming housework. If such jobs are shared to men, it is highly that such burdens are minimised, thus being treated more fairly.
Another compelling reason for having both males and females engaging in doing household chores is the reduction in a family dispute. If such duties are mainly done by only men or women, the other tends to feel overwhelmed, which might, in turn, lead to domestic argument and violence. A clear explanation is a higher rate of divorce in America, which is caused by the unnecessary argument made by young adult couples.
In conclusion, while more men and women seem to work full-time nowadays, it is advisable that they both should take responsibility for doing housework. I agree with this as believe that It is fair and will help minimise arguments among family members, leading to an equality society and a healthy family unit.",,,,,,7.5,"As more women and men pursue full-time careers across the globe, it is only logical that household responsibilities should be distributed equally between both partners. I strongly support this idea because shared chores strengthen the principle of fairness and improve the overall quality of family life. In the past, society often expected women to singlehandedly manage housework, even if they were employed outside the home as well. This unfair division meant many women carried a double burden, often leading to exhaustion and resentment. If couples jointly handle domestic duties, it not only balances their workloads but also fosters better mutual respect and understanding within the relationship. Moreover, shared responsibility can provide valuable opportunities for couples to spend time together while accomplishing everyday tasks, which can promote stronger family bonds. It also sets a positive example for children, teaching them early on about equality and cooperation regardless of gender. Therefore, given the evolving roles of both men and women in the workforce, I firmly believe that they should equally share the tasks at home, as this approach promotes both justice and harmony in modern families."
679,2,In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development,"Striving for own career development is most of the people's lifetime target in the modern city. In some nations, employees spend long time at work becomes a phenomenon. This essay is going yo discuss the reasons behind and I reckon that this is a negative development for both the companies and employees.
There are two main reasons behind this phenomenon. Firstly, it could be the corporate culture of the company. The management members of the company may agree that workers spending a long period of time in the office equals to excellent performance. For instance, employees in Japanese company could get a greater annual bonus or better chance to promote if they are eager to work for a long hours. This forces the employees to to show up in the office just because of giving a good impression to the boss.
Secondly, as the competition between different companies in the market is nervous, coporate sectors are willing to push their colleagues to enhance their sales or performance. It causes a great pressure to the employees whom need to work for long hours to fuifill the expectation from the managements. For example, product sales agents' performance depends on the sales number quarterly. If the agent cannot sale the products effectively, they will receive less revenues or even being sacked.
As per the reasons stated, I absolutely think that it is a negative development for both the employees and companies. It is because it gives the unnecessary pressure to the colleagues which will affect their mental health. Inversely, it downgrades the performance of the employee as well as the company. Work-life balance is important to everyone as suitable relaxing time can considerably enhance the performance of human.",,,,,,7.5,"In many countries, it is becoming common for people to work extended hours each day. This situation can be attributed to several major causes. One significant reason is the rising competition in the global economy, leading both employers and employees to feel pressure to perform better than their rivals. As a result, managers often expect staff to stay late in order to complete tasks or demonstrate their commitment to the company. Furthermore, the increase in living costs pushes individuals to work longer in hopes of gaining overtime pay or promotions, which may improve their financial situation. However, I believe this trend is largely negative. Working such long hours frequently results in severe stress and can damage physical and mental health, leaving workers with little time to rest or spend with their families. Moreover, employees who are constantly exhausted are less likely to be innovative or productive in the long run. Therefore, while the reasons for this phenomenon are understandable, the negative impacts outweigh the benefits, and societies should find ways to encourage a healthier work-life balance."
681,2,In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development,"Nowadays, many businesses have to compete each other in order to survive from the rapidly changing world, leading to the high amount of time that employees spend on working. There are also other reasons why the employees work for a long period which I will discuss in this essay. In terms of consequences, I personally believe that spending most of our time at work is the negative development.
It is the fact that people have various rationales to work for long hours. A classic example is the dynamic working condition. There are many companies that provide services such as consultation to customers, meaning that if their service does not completely satisfy the clients’ need, such client may decide to use the service from other competitors. Hence, the employees are required to dedicate their time to deliver the best service to the clients. Another common criticism is a bright career path. When the employees work for a long period, they can carefully check their works and, as a result, delivery the works with less mistakes. Doing this way could impress their manager and they are likely to get promotion in return.
With a careful consideration regarding the consequence of working for long hours, there are many vital drawbacks. An obvious effect is the increase in illness. People who work very hard have to spend a lot of their time at work. Therefore, they may not have enough time to do exercises, weakening the immune system of their body. Furthermore, with the rise in the amount of working hours, people tend to lack social skills. This is because they may not be able to manage time to join social events or meet their friends, resulting in the less ability to adapt to new environments.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that people work for long hours because of the requirement in business and personal career goal which, in my opinion, leads to negative development for themselves. This is because this behavior negatively affects their health condition and social competency which are the two most important aspects in our life.",,,,,,7.0,"In many countries, people find themselves working extended hours at their jobs, and there are various reasons why this pattern exists. One clear cause is the pressure from the modern economic environment, where companies must constantly innovate and respond quickly to customer demands to remain successful. As a result, employees are often expected to be available beyond the traditional workday and put in extra effort to meet tight deadlines. In addition, some individuals choose to work longer hours in pursuit of higher salaries or hopes for a better position, believing that dedication and hard work will be rewarded by their employers. However, I consider this trend to be negative for several reasons. Firstly, working excessively can have serious health consequences, such as increased stress and a lack of time for rest or physical activity, which may lead to chronic illnesses. Secondly, spending too much time at work often disrupts an individual’s work-life balance, reducing opportunities for family interaction and personal interests, which are essential for mental well-being. In summary, even though economic competitiveness and personal ambition drive people to work long hours, I believe that these long-term effects on health and life satisfaction make it a negative development overall."
683,2,In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development,"In some countries, including Japan, people tend to spend long hours at work. In recent years, this issue is often discussed around Japan. Although some Japanese people take it positively, I strongly oppose this idea and believe it is no longer positive development now. I would like to state some reasons with some examples in Japanese society.
Firstly, the Japanese economy used to be the worst poverty country around the world after world war two. Many buildings and companies were devastated, therefore, Japanese people stucked together on how to recover the damage and improve their economy. As a result, the Japanese economy has drastically and steadily developed. As a result, the Japanese economy was about to be the wealthiest country by 1980. In these periods from 1950 to 1990, the longer people work, the more money returned to employees. In addition, it was traditionally believed for Japanese people that it is virtue to work long hours in Japanese society.
But the economic bubble suddenly exploded in 1992, Japanese economy suddenly declined and economic growth still remains the same in 2022. Sadly, working long hours is not necessarily connected to companies profit. Although it is because of economic recession, companies still believed that it is important to work hours will result in increase company's profit. As a result, some people became workaholics and the number of people who are suffering from mental depression. Currently, Japan is one of the highest suicide rates in developed countries.
Finally, in my opinion, the most important point is how productive systems companies and organizations need to create. For example, many companies tend to rely on too much tasks for employees who have better skills or positions than other employees. Therefore, they need to provide some curriculums about specific skills in IT, language, and accountant. If each employee upskilled their ability, it would be able to divide and conquer the tasks more efficiently. In addition, it must be more effective to adopt intern-ship work opportunities for university students. This means that those who already have work experience beforehand will cause to reduce their training time.
In conclusion, Japanese society is suffering from depopulation, too. This means that Japanese people are required to work with less volume workforce. Therefore, companies and the government need to consider how to work efficiently and reduce too much tasks in one employee. I believe Japanese people will be able to resolve this problem, because they are so diligent and made many success to make a countermeasure by a long history.",,,,,,6.5,"In some countries, it is common for people to spend a significant amount of time at their workplaces, and this trend can be observed in places such as South Korea and China. The reasons behind this phenomenon are varied. One primary reason is the competitive job market, which pushes people to work harder in order to maintain job security and earn promotions. Additionally, in many Asian cultures, there is a strong emphasis on showing loyalty and dedication to one’s company, often resulting in employees feeling pressured to stay longer hours. While some employers might think that longer work hours lead to increased productivity, I personally believe this is a negative development overall. Prolonged working hours can result in higher stress levels, burnout, and health problems for employees. Moreover, people have less time to spend with their families or pursue hobbies, which can lead to a decrease in overall life satisfaction. Studies have shown that investing in work-life balance and efficiency rather than just time spent at work can boost both productivity and happiness. In conclusion, though there are historical and cultural reasons for long hours at work in some nations, I think it would be more beneficial for both individuals and society if companies focused on results, not just hours, allowing workers a healthier and more balanced life."
685,2,In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development,"It is often the arguement and debate of the main reasons for why employees spend longer hours at their jobs and what are the consequences of it. This essay will argue this statement, provide top reasons and main outcomes of doing so and give some relevant examples.
There are several reasons why workers tend to spend too much time at their jobs, beyond the work hours stated in the contracts. One reason could be that those employees have recently joined the company and they want to leave a good impression on their supervisors during the three-month probation period. Another factor is related to the many various tasks and projects given all at once, hence they get stressed out as they're restricted with the deadlines. On the other hand, some are just staying at work for a prolonged period is for the sake of self-development, e.g. studying for some certification programs, online master degree, etc.
When it comes to the consequences, it can be either positive or negative, depending on the reason itself. If it is self-development then it is a good thing. In contrast, if this keeps repeating everyday then it is unhealthy for both the body and the mentality. Also, it can affect the social life and a marriage relationship. As an illustration, some countries (such as Dubai) have reduced the work hours and the outcome of this study was found satisfactory, i.g. the employees have become more productive, fruitful, and the quality of their inputs drastically improved.
To sum up, the best and optimal choice is to balance between the social life and the time spent at work. If we constantly adopt such habit this will affect our health (physically and mentally) and as a result the contribution and performance will deteriorate and the required job won't be done at a satisfactory level.",,,,,,6.0,"In many nations, people find themselves working extra hours due to a combination of competition, economic demands, and shifting workplace cultures. One main cause is the rising cost of living, which forces many to work longer to afford basic necessities or to save for the future. Additionally, some companies create environments where staying late is seen as a sign of dedication, which may push employees to work beyond their usual hours to gain recognition or promotions. While working longer can bring about certain advantages, such as faster career advancement and financial rewards, there are negative consequences too. Prolonged overtime often leads to increased stress, health problems, and a lack of personal time for family or hobbies, which can decrease overall life satisfaction. In some examples, countries with shorter workweeks have reported higher employee happiness and better productivity. Therefore, while some extra effort at work might be positive if it is for personal development or financial goals, it can become a harmful trend if it turns into a regular routine and harms well-being."
687,2,In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development,"In recent times as technology progresses, majority of people have spent longer time at work for many reasons which can be caused by a high work demands and people need to cope with their daily living. This development would have negative connotations, if people would not have a work-life balance and gradually affect their health.
Numerous workers have sometimes oblige to stay at work longer. Firstly, there are huge companies that need more workforce and time to keep up with work requirements. As an individual worker, sometimes requires to extend their work hours to finish the workload and assigned tasks. In most shipping companies or factories in the Philippines, for instance, there often have an outrageous number of workload to be done therefore multitude employees have been tied up to work and forced to render overtime. Secondly, nowadays people are facing in large of debts and bills. In Canada, the cost of living is quite high and unaffordable for some, so that several people work double jobs or often do overtime to earn extra more.
Spending too much hours working has two possible drawbacks, an absence or lack of work-life balance and acquiring diseases in the long run. For married people, family time is significantly valuable in order to maintain a good family bond. Workaholic people have the tendency to negelct the importance of family bonding and tend to experience health problems thereafter. According to one research in the US, found that the number of workaholic people was tripled from 10 million to about 30 million in over a decade and majority of these people suffered from stress- related diseases such as depression, heart disease and chronic back pain.
To conclude, most people have spent longer time working due to extreme work demands and personal financial challenges. Although this gives some benefits to oneself or companies, it can turn one's life into unhappy and unhealthy life.",,,,,,7.0,"In many countries, it is becoming increasingly common for people to spend many hours at work, and there are several reasons behind this growing trend. One important factor is the pressure from employers, as companies often expect their staff to be available at all times to meet strict deadlines or to remain competitive in the market. Additionally, many individuals feel the financial burden of supporting themselves or their families, so they agree to more work in exchange for a higher income or job security. For instance, in nations where the cost of living is high, such as Japan or South Korea, people often accept overtime as a necessary part of life to afford housing and other essentials. However, this practice is generally seen as a negative development. Working excessively long hours can hurt health, leading to fatigue, stress, and even serious illnesses like heart problems. Furthermore, lack of time for relaxation and personal relationships may cause family breakdowns and a feeling of isolation. In conclusion, while there are understandable reasons why people work such long hours, the consequences for health and personal wellbeing suggest that this is largely an unfavorable trend."
689,2,Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Some people strongly argue that money has to be shared for other ways. In contrast, it is necessary to invest money for developing the technology for space exploration. Although there are some benefits to spend money for space exploration, I believe the money should be spent for a disparity of wealth and environment.
Initially, developing the technology for space exploration is necessary to some extent. For example, if people found a drastically innovative resource on another planet that takes the place of current resources, specifically, fossil fuel, and wood.
People do not need to take care of limited resources on the earth any more. In addition, improving technology will cause to people's convenience on earth as a result. For example, recently some scientists are planning to launch a space rocket as a transport system on earth. hat it takes only two hours between New York and Shanghai by rocket.
On the other hand, there are a lot of problems on earth. Especially, in developing countries, people are suffering from poverty while in developed countries waste massive food. In addition, even in developed countries, the disparity of wealth has been widening. Therefore, the money which is spent on space exploration should be used for all people's lives more safely around the world. Developed countries must have many options to give a hand to developing countries. For example, it must be effective to provide infrastructure, agriculture, and sharing clothing and food that are about to dispose of in developed countries.
Finally, including my opinion, people can not choose their own nationality. This means that people who were born in a developing country and need to be suffered from poverty are definitely unfair. Therefore, the money is spent on space exploration partially spend for developing countries. As a result, the disparity of wealth will not be wider and people will be able to live with the same quality of lifestyle as developed countries to some extent.",,,,,,7.0,"The debate about whether investing money in space exploration technology is justified has drawn mixed opinions. While some insist that these vast sums should be focused on urgent issues on earth, others believe space research can bring benefits for humanity. Indeed, developing space technology can help people find new resources or discover solutions to critical problems such as climate change. For example, satellites have already improved our ability to predict natural disasters and monitor environmental changes. Moreover, advancements made for space often lead to new inventions that make daily life more comfortable, like improved medical tools and communication systems. However, it is clear that many people in the world are struggling with poverty, lack of education, and health crises. These problems require immediate financial support, and spending on space projects can seem irresponsible when basic human needs are unmet. For example, many families do not have safe water or enough food, but immense budgets are given to launch rockets. In my opinion, while some funding for space exploration should continue because of its potential long-term benefits, a greater portion of money should be directed toward solving problems here on earth. This way, we can balance the excitement of discovering new frontiers with the responsibility to take care of each other and the planet we inhabit."
691,2,Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"These days the space exploration is not just an imagination since human beings landed and step their foot on the moon decades ago. In addition, the fast technology evolution in the present came from the concerns of many scientists around the world. Some people believe that focusing on the space evolution matter. While others argue that they should invest inside the country. In my opinion, the exploration of our planet could enhance people's lives in many different ways. However, the human organization should do the best in other more useful sectors to improve human needs.
On one hand, the space exploration has always been a fascinating topic over recent years. Scientists researching to find out and trying to know what is hiding out of the black hole and another universal plant if it is livable or has any natural resources. For example, in 1991 research proved that to travel from the earth to the nearest planet it could take approximately 3 to 4 months continually. In other words, exploration of a planet is costly as well as takes much time to reach it.
On the other hand, the benefit of universe exploration may change our earth's environment and improve our lives for the next coming generation in technology. For instance, people after the year 2000 had better communication with each other which was not even possible at any time ever. Moreover, the government invests to develop space exploration companies.
In conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view I strongly believe that space companies such as SpaceX must try to find a new resources to visit other planets. However, I agree that they should be done after providing the basic needs of the human on earth and investing to solve poverty and any other human tragedies.",,,,,,6.5,"In modern times, the question of whether to spend money on space exploration or other pressing needs on earth has sparked ongoing debate. Some individuals argue that vast sums directed at developing new technology for space exploration could instead be used to tackle urgent matters such as poverty, education, and healthcare. For example, many countries face challenges like insufficient hospital facilities and lack of access to clean water, which could directly benefit from increased funding. However, it is also important to recognize the broader positives that have resulted from space research. Advances in satellite technology have improved communication and weather forecasting, and even resulted in materials and devices that are now commonly used in everyday life. Nevertheless, sending missions to other planets is still extremely costly and does not always guarantee immediate returns. In summary, while I appreciate that space exploration leads to valuable scientific progress, I believe that investments should prioritize solving critical issues on earth before committing large funds to exploring outer space."
693,2,Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Space, so unknown for the humankind that it generates so much curiosity among experts and enterprenues. Due to this curiosity, the amount of resources and money invested in its exploration is surprisingly big. Developing technology for it is expensive but, in my humble opinion, completly justified.
Firstly, developing technology is vital so that space exploration can be carried out succesfully. Experts have discovered that we only know a 4 percent of the entire universe. If with only that 4 percent we have accomplished amazing achievements, imagine what the human race could do when knowing a 10 percent.
Secondly, space exploration and the technology involve on it not only will help the human race understand the universe but also will provide a whole new kind of tourism, space tourism. The CEOs of some of the most profitable business in America are investigating this possibility. The leading enterprises in this sector are Blue Origin from Jeff Bezos and Space X from Elon Musk. When discovered the way of sending people to space safely, space tourism will generate twice the money spent on technology for space exploration.
In a nutshell, space exploration is crutial for the development of the human race. Furthermore, if this was not enough, all the technology developed will serve the purpose of creating a whole new kind of tourism that will generate billions of dollars in revenue. From my point of view, even though here on earth there are several problems to be solve with money, our future lies on space, so be must spend as much money as possible.",,,,,,7.0,"The debate surrounding the funding of space exploration technology is both complex and fascinating. Many critics argue that the enormous sums devoted to developing rockets, satellites, and spacecraft could be more usefully spent addressing problems such as poverty, healthcare, or climate change on earth. However, I strongly believe that the investment in space technology is completely justified. To begin with, the advancements born out of space research often lead to innovations that benefit many industries on earth, from medical imaging to improved telecommunications. The technologies developed for space missions are frequently adapted in ways that improve our everyday lives. Additionally, exploring space expands humanity’s knowledge and offers the hope of solutions to longstanding issues, such as limited resources or even overpopulation, by potentially identifying new habitats or materials. While the argument to address urgent earthbound issues first is understandable, it is also true that pausing or eliminating progress in space exploration would mean missing out on crucial scientific and economic opportunities. In conclusion, although there are pressing societal needs that require funding, the money spent on developing space technology is an invaluable investment in both our present and our future."
695,2,Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Space exploration has no longer been a si-fi fantasy since human-beings placed their first steps on the moon in 1950s. However, rapid evolution of technologies and the fast consumption of natural resources are also major concerns for many scientists in today's world. Some people believe that more money spent on space exploration is inevitable for fulfulling the demands of scientific discovery and the future development of human technologies; however, many others argue that this money should be invested in other more useful places where more human lives can be improved.
Space exploration has always been a fascinating topic over the recent years. Scientists have long been searching for possible ways to contact the unknown lives outside this planet and unwrap the secrets of the universe such as the black holes and the birth of the space. The more advanced human-technologies become, the further an austronaut can travel to. Scientists believe that space discoveries can help human beings to develop new technologies and find new resources outside our solar system. However, the evolutions of technologies and equipments always require huge investments.
In fact, space exploration can be both benefitial and time-consuming. If such a scientific project is carried and supervised by a rich nation, greater success can be seen. However, there are many other pre-existing problems on the other side of this planet that require attention and aids, such as hunger and proverty. In this case, I think these issues should be prioritized because every human life is precious. If those people's lives are taken care off, there should be less worries on scientific research as well.
In conclusion, space exploration can be benefitial for the evolution of human technologies and possible findings of new resources. However, they should be done after fulfilling the basic needs other people on the other side of this planet.",,,,,,7.5,"In modern society, the debate over funding for space exploration remains a controversial issue. Although some argue that investing billions of dollars in discovering the mysteries of the universe is essential for scientific advancement, others believe that such funds could be better spent on pressing problems within our own world. Space exploration has certainly led to breakthroughs in technology and a deeper understanding of our place in the cosmos, with inventions like satellites and improvements in communication. Despite these achievements, challenges such as poverty, lack of clean water, and inadequate healthcare still affect countless people every day. I personally agree that while exploring space can have long-term benefits, the immediate needs of humanity should take priority. Providing basic necessities for everyone would not only improve quality of life, but also create a more stable foundation for future scientific pursuits. In summary, exploring the universe is worthy of investment, but I believe funds should first be allocated to address urgent issues facing many people on Earth."
697,2,Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"Some governments budget a considerable amount of expenditure on space exaploration, yet many opponents voice their opinion that it is meaningless to financially support this aspect, and this money should be alternatively allotted on other more important priorities. My firm conviction is that it is rewarding to pour money into exploring outer space since it might produce long-term benefits.
From a short-term pespective, there are seemingly compelling reasons to exclude space exploration from the national budget. The result of exploring the exterrestrial space is unpredictable. If research fails, it would be a loss of financial resources considering the huge cost. Besides, compared with space exploration, education inequality, health care problems and underdeveloped infrastuctures are more urgent issues, meaning that money spent on these facets may produce immediate benefits for people's quality of life.
However, I firmly believe we should hold a long-term perspective and figure out potential merits brought about by exploring and researching the outer space. First of all, environmental problems, such as global warming and water shortage, are gradually worsening and threatening people's health to a large extent. Allocating financial resources on space exploration could further investigate and prove whether there are life forms or natural resources on another planet, which might provide a soultion to those long-exisiting environmental issues. Also, many exisiting technologies closely associated with the daily life of mainkind, such as weather forcast and earthquake anticipation, are also highly reliant on the space technology. This will allow humans to take necessary precautions in the face of some urgent situations.
To summarize, I believe space exploration is a long-term solution to many existing problems on this planet, and thus deserve adaquate government expenditure.",,,,,,8.0,"While many individuals argue that investing massive funds into the technology required for space exploration cannot be justified when there are more immediate concerns on Earth, I am convinced that supporting space programs is both meaningful and forward-thinking. Admittedly, pressing issues such as poverty, disease, and lack of access to quality education should not be ignored, and immediate financial support in these areas can greatly improve living standards. Moreover, the high risks and unpredictability attached to outer space explorations may appear to make such financial commitments questionable, as failures could result in substantial economic loss with seemingly little direct benefit to the common people. However, a closer inspection reveals the long-term rewards that space exploration brings to humanity. Technological advancements achieved through space programs, such as satellite communications and global positioning systems, have become indispensable parts of modern life. Additionally, the pursuit of knowledge regarding other planets could offer solutions to environmental disasters, overpopulation, or resource depletion that threaten the Earth. Scientific achievements made possible through funding space research can, directly and indirectly, contribute to global progress and problem-solving in ways that purely terrestrial projects may not. In summary, I believe that government investments in space exploration are not only justified but necessary for the advancement and continued survival of humankind."
699,2,Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"For years, space has fascinated humans. The idea that there could be life on other planets, as well as the challenge of exploring as much of the universe as possible, has been one that has excited everyone from top physicists, to the youngest child playing with her space ship toys. But is the money spent on exploration of the universe justified or should it rather be allocated to helping those on this planet? I believe that space exploration is justified. In this essay, the motivation for space exploration will be explored.
Planet Earth is ill. Humans have polluted the planet and destroying natural resources. Some might argue that the damage is irreparable. Global warming is causing the Earth's temperature to steadily rise. There is a possibility that in the next few centuries, the planet may become inhabitable. Scientists like Elon Musk have recognised the dire situation that the Earth is in, and have started looking for an alternative new home planet. It is possible that in the coming years, there will be no other option than to move to a planet like Mars. Therefore, the costs involved in exploring this planet are justified, if it is to house the entire human race.
Space exploration also allows for new discoveries. New minerals or compounds could be discovered on distant planets. These could possibly be used on Earth in various new technologies, or even in medical science to treat illness or disease. This could be invaluable to humankind.
Since the dawn of the human race, a characteristic that separates us from our animal relatives, is our ability to tinker with existing knowledge, as well as learn new things. It has lead to humans becoming the dominant force on the planet. New ideas prevent us from becoming stagnant, thus driving progress. If we continue to learn new things from space exploration, we prevent stagnation.
Lastly, the idea that there could be life on other planets is one that has merit, in my opinion. Humans cannot be so arrogant to think that there is no other life in the universe.
In conclusion, it can be argued that space exploration does not hold merit and should be discontinued. But the benefits that it offers outweigh the shortcomings.",,,,,,8.5,"The debate over whether investing large sums in space exploration is a wise use of resources is ongoing. Some people argue that these vast amounts of money would be better spent solving problems here on Earth, such as hunger, poverty, or better healthcare. However, I am of the opinion that funding space exploration is justified for several important reasons. First, many challenges we face on Earth have benefited from technologies developed for exploring space, including advancements in communication, weather forecasting, and even materials science. Without this technological push, our everyday lives would look very different—and likely not for the better. Secondly, exploring space fuels human curiosity and encourages scientific discovery, which can inspire younger generations to pursue careers in science and engineering, strengthening society’s ability to solve complex problems. Furthermore, as our planet faces mounting environmental threats, such as climate change and resource depletion, studying other planets could provide crucial knowledge about Earth's future and possible solutions. Space exploration may even be humanity’s backup plan if our own world becomes uninhabitable. In short, while the cost is high, the benefits of space exploration extend well beyond just finding new worlds; they actively improve lives on Earth, and for this reason, I believe the expenditure is justified."
701,2,Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?,"Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. In this essay, the reason for wasting food and the acts which can be done by humans to reduce the amount of food one throws away will be thorougly discussed.
Firstly, people waste food as one tends to be satisfied with the amount one eats. Thus, people order food more than one can eat as one can not estimate the amount of food. The amount of food one person can consume differs on one's conditions at that moment. The conditions include mood, physical features and activities one did on that particular day. Furthermore, one wants to taste all sorts of food, however, one can not eat all of those. Sometimes, people order food which are well decorated just to take a photo of it and upload it on social media such as Instagram. After taking photo, people just leave the food. The above mentioned reasons can be the causes of wastage of food.
Apparently, people can reduce the amount of food they throw away. The restaurants can provide more informations about the amount and taste briefly to avoid the situation that consumers can not finish the food and are dissatisfied with the taste or smell. Moreover, consumers have to make a wise decision so that they do not waste both food and money. People should co-operate to reduce the wastage of food as it causes pollution on land. It leads to bad smell and brings insects to the areas.
Conclusively, it is quite clear that people greatly waste food and there are a few ways for people to follow so as to reduce the amount of waste food.",,,,,,7.0,"In recent times, it has become common for people to throw away food that they buy from stores and restaurants. There are a number of reasons behind this habit of wasting food. One reason is that many customers buy more food than they actually need, either because they are tempted by discounts or because they misjudge how much they can eat. Another cause is the trend of trying different dishes for novelty or taking photos to share on social media, but then not finishing the meal afterwards. Additionally, some people are not aware of how to store food properly, which leads to spoilage before they can eat it. To address this issue, several actions can be taken. Firstly, restaurants and shops can offer smaller portions or provide customers with better information about portion sizes to help them order more responsibly. Moreover, raising public awareness about the environmental impact of wasting food can encourage people to change their habits. Individuals should also plan their grocery shopping and meals more carefully in order to avoid buying excessive amounts. In conclusion, while there are various reasons why food is wasted, both individuals and businesses can take steps to help reduce the problem and make a positive difference."
703,2,People think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.,"It is undeniable that crime inevitably contributes to negative consequences to society, which affects in various aspects. Hence, there is a belief that giving longer prison sentences could be the most effective way to reduce the crime rate. Nevertheless, there are also opponents who believe that other effective mitigations are also available which I personally agree with.
It is true that being sentenced for a very long period is what people do not want to experience. A criticism in favor of this is that those who live in prison will lack freedom. This is because prisoners will be forced to stay in jail only, meaning that they could not meet their companions as well as traveling to another country until the end of the prison term. Another common example which supports the idea of increasing the sentence term is that prisoners will be under control by authorities all time. Living in this condition would possibly result in the loss of privacy, which is the experience that people tend to avoid.
In spite of the fact that giving longer sentences seems to be effective, other solutions could also be applied. A classic example is that people who break the laws must pay an extremely high penalty to governments. Since people do not want to lose their money, this policy is likely to encourage people to follow the laws, leading to the declining number of crime. Another potential solution could be done by schools to teach young generations about the effects of crime. Once students understand that committing crime would lead to the lower standard of living of people in communities such as reducing in the neighbors' safety, they tend to behave in the opposite way which is to improve the living conditions of other people instead and this would have hugely positive impacts in the long term.
In conclusion, despite the fact that being in prison for a long time is a completely terrible experience for people because of no flexibility and privacy in life, it seems to me that other alternatives which are paying higher fines and educating young people with respect to negative effects of crime tend to be more effective. This is because these solutions are likely to address the root cause of committing crime and tend to be more applicable in the long run.",,,,,,7.0,"The issue of how to effectively reduce crime rates is highly debated, with some advocating for longer prison sentences while others believe alternative approaches are more beneficial. Supporters of imposing extended prison terms often argue that the fear of spending many years incarcerated can act as a strong deterrent, discouraging individuals from engaging in criminal behavior. For instance, losing one’s freedom and being separated from family and society for a significant period is something most people wish to avoid, which could reduce the likelihood of committing offenses. There is also the idea that keeping offenders off the streets for longer helps protect society by preventing repeat crimes. On the other hand, opponents of this strategy claim that simply increasing prison time does not address the underlying causes of criminal activity. Many suggest that focusing on rehabilitation, improving education, and offering better job opportunities would more effectively prevent crime over time. For example, giving people second chances through training or therapy could lead to lower rates of reoffending, and community programs can create a sense of belonging that discourages illegal actions. In my opinion, while longer prison sentences may help in certain serious cases, alternative solutions such as social support and preventive education are more effective in reducing crime in the long run, as they tackle the root problems rather than the symptoms."
705,2,People think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.,"The topic of whether giving longer prison sentences lead to a decrease in the rate of crime or some other alternative solutions might be helpful to reduce the rate of crime. Although it depends on each country's crime rate and cost, I believe some alternative solutions will be realistic for reducing crime.
First of all, some people believe giving a long sentence will be not only a safe solution, but also useful to pay an attention to other people not to commit a crime. They state that this is the best way in terms of cost, and the organization well systemized. They believe the crime rate will go down as a result.
On the other hand, some people oppose the system. The longer prison sentences have an influence to some extent. But for the victims and their families can not be convinced, and if alternative systems are well organized, some crimes might be prevented in advance. Therefore, it must be necessary to deploy the military or police in a specific area where crimes often occur. This is effective to inhibit the crime rate.
Finally, crimes, criminals often sporadically emerge, even if the government stipulates the law which serves long prison sentences. This is ubiquitous around the world. Therefore, the most important point is how people need to become aware of dangerous situations and avoid not being involved. In addition, governments need to delegate stronger authority to the police and military to patrol around the specific area twenty-four seven, as comparatively higher crimes occur in the town. This might be costly, but it is worthwhile to configure a safe society.",,,,,,6.0,"The issue of whether longer prison sentences are the most effective way to reduce crime or if alternative approaches should be considered is an ongoing debate in many countries. Supporters of longer prison sentences argue that they act as a strong deterrent, making people think twice before committing illegal acts, and believe that keeping criminals off the streets leads to safer communities. This approach, according to them, is straightforward to implement and does not require as much reform or investment as other methods. On the contrary, those who support alternative solutions often point out that simply lengthening prison time may not address the underlying reasons why people commit crimes, such as poverty, lack of education, or unemployment. They suggest that investing in rehabilitation, education, and social support can create long-term changes and prevent people from turning to crime in the first place. In my opinion, while ensuring public safety is vital, a combination of both approaches would likely be most effective. Relying solely on longer sentences may not change criminals’ behavior, whereas alternative solutions have the potential to address root causes and offer people better futures, ultimately leading to a more lasting reduction in crime rates."
707,2,People think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.,"Some people share the view, that for minimising criminality offenders should go to jail for a long time while others are of the view, that this problem should be tackled by using alternatives solutions. I believe, that the judicial system should look for other ways to punish criminals depending on the severity of the offence.
Firstly, by keeping people encarcelated for years, 'the problem is locked up' and there is no need to dealt with it until the sentence is served. For instance, for individuals who have committed a serious crime such as murder, a long sentence is appropriate due to the severity of it and the criminal's possible danger for the society. On the contrary, for little criminals, like robbery, mild sentences or social hours should be considered as an option.
On the other hand, by trying to get these individuals before they commit a severe crime, could be a clever step. For example, in Switzerland, social workers work very hard to get, mostly youngster, an apprenticeship. So, they are kept busy and usually happy. By placing people to jail for a long time, they loose the contact to the outside world. Therefore, trying to keep them outside doing the activities they were doing before the crime, would be a reasonable. In other words, these citizens could wear electronically sensors, so that the judicial services can check on them. That would be a win-win situation for the government, society due to the lower cost compared to the jail expenses and for the individual who can continuing with his/her life.
In brief, despite some circumstances for jailing an individual, I believe, that alternative ways of punishment should always be on option depending on the degree of the crime.",,,,,,7.0,"There are differing opinions about whether harsher prison sentences are the most effective way to cut down on crime, or if other strategies should be tried. On one hand, some people say that by keeping offenders behind bars for a longer period, society can be protected from dangerous people, and this could also discourage others from committing crimes out of fear of getting a severe punishment. For very violent or repeat criminals, giving long sentences may indeed be necessary to keep the public safe. On the other hand, many believe that crime can also be lowered by addressing its root causes, such as poverty and lack of education or job opportunities. For example, programs that help people get skills or work can give them reasons not to break the law. In some countries, efforts like counseling, community service, or monitoring with electronic devices have shown success for less serious crimes. Personally, I feel that a mix of both approaches is best; for major crimes longer prison terms are justified, but for minor or first-time offenses, alternatives such as rehabilitation or community service make more sense and help prevent people from becoming repeat offenders. In conclusion, while tough prison sentences have their place for certain crimes, using other solutions where suitable can lead to a safer and more fair society."

This essay will talk about both views and, at the end, I will give my opinion about the argument.
It is always more common to see long sentences for criminals, also if their crimes are not too bad to deserve that type of punishment; the reason why the court gives to them long sentences is because they think that staying a lot in prison will make the criminals understand that what they did is wrong and, next time, they will think twice before doing something bad or against the law.
However long sentences can go against the human rights because they will take away from prisoners years of their life; for this reason, some people think that it can be better if, instead of stay close in a jail without doing nothing, they can be used in various works that will make them useful for the society and better person at the end of the sentence, like cleaning the city, helping old people in retirement homes and also cook for poor people.
I think that there are other ways to stop crime instead of giving long punishments, also because everyone should have a second chance in their life and, more importantly, teach and show to prisoners different aspects of the community will help cities to become better places with less crimes to stop.
This essay talked about two different types of views about crime sentences in our society, with my own opinion about the argument in the last part of it.",,,,,,7.0,"Some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to stop crime, because they think that if criminals are afraid of spending many years behind bars, they will not want to do anything illegal. People who support this idea also hope that a long time in prison will make criminals change their behaviour, so that when they come out, they will not commit another crime. On the other hand, there are people who think that longer sentences are not always the answer, and that there are different solutions that might work better. For example, they argue that education, job opportunities, and support programmes can help people find a better life and not need to steal or hurt others. In addition, they say that putting someone in jail for too many years may not always help, because the person will lose contact with normal life, and it could make it harder for them to live honestly when they are released. In my opinion, I think it is important to find a balance; dangerous criminals may need to be locked up for the safety of others, but for many people, helping them change and find a better path could prevent future crimes and make the community safer. After thinking about both sides, I believe that working to solve the reasons behind crime will be more effective than simply increasing prison time for everyone."

713,2,"In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","According to COVID-19 event forced many company to change their way of working. One of the most significant transformation is the communication. The online communication becomes a must or inevitable for the company to be implemented. In this topic, we're going to disscuss the advantages and disadvantages for both ways of communications. The online meeting can introduce a significant impact to the organization while face to face meeting can be outdated for this new era of 2021.
First of all for the online communication's advantages is that in the pandemic period the actual physical contact is a significant way to transmit the disease. Video conference can help mitigate this problem by lower the physical contact for each conversation or meeting. Also communicates through online channel can help individual to organize or manage their time efficiently according to each person preference. For example, a single mom parent may be able to spend times for her sons/daughters at home, while be able to have a cross country meeting with another department in other region. Another reason is that some people are quite introvert and find it difficult for face to face human interactions or conversations, in which online chat or messages can help them to mitigate this problem and communicate efficiently. Lastly as mentioned about video conference across region, online meeting can help the multi-national corporates save the transporations cost and additional resources needed to spend for face to face meeting.
For the disadvantages, all of the online communications required hardware, internet connection and technological knowledge on how to use them. This technological gap can be seen as one of the most significant obstracle or disadvantage for people to use online communications. For example, in one company, there obviously have a various age of people, in which some of them are not familiar with the technology. Since video call conference has been introduced and utilized widespread among corporates not so long time ago. This can be a big technological gap for some people to use the online communications and result in a lost in communications among the workplaces.
As a result, online communication helps an organization to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease, improved the time mangement ability and productivity for each individuals, and lower the financial cost or resources required to spends for international business activities. With all these advantages of online communication stated, they can be seens as a significant reasons to outweight the disadvantages of technological gap on this current year of 2021.",,,,,,5.0,"The rise of online communication in the workplace has dramatically changed the way colleagues interact and collaborate. There are several important advantages to this trend. One of the biggest is convenience, as employees can join meetings or share information quickly without having to travel or book meeting rooms. This can save a lot of time and also allows people who live far away or work from home to participate equally. Furthermore, online tools such as emails, messaging apps, and video calls make it easier to keep records of discussions and decisions, which can be helpful for future reference. However, there are also some disadvantages to consider. Face-to-face meetings can sometimes create stronger personal connections and trust between coworkers, which may get lost behind a computer screen. Misunderstandings can also happen more easily when people cannot read body language or tone. Some employees, especially older ones, may struggle with new technologies, creating a gap between staff members. Nevertheless, I believe that the advantages of online communication—especially its efficiency, accessibility, and adaptability—are more significant than the drawbacks. As technology improves and people become more accustomed to it, many of the existing disadvantages can be reduced or solved, making online communication a generally positive development for workplaces."
715,2,"In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","With new technologies come new ways to communicate with people. First, we had emails and now we have social media and a variety of different apps that give us the opportunity to chat with one another. And this kind of online communication entered not only our personal but also our professional life. This topic is rather controversial and people have different opinions about that, so in this essay, I'm gonna be talking about pros and cons of the new type of working communication.
First, I would like to start with some advantages of online communication at work. In my opinion, the main thing that makes people go from meeting face to face to talk online is the fact that it's more convenient. We don't have to set a specific date to meet someone. And also we can talk to someone from wherever we want, without needing to drive to the office. The two things we need are our cellphone or computer and the internet connection. But I think nowadays it won't be a problem for anyone because the majority of people have each of this stuff.
The second advantage - the functionality of apps for online communication. Let's take Zoom. I think almost everyone used this app in 2020 during lockdowns all over the world, including myself. You can arrange a meeting with thousands of people, using this app. This is much easier than gathering large amounts of people in one place. You can also record this meeting if you wish and send this recording to people who were absent or use it yourself in the future to remember all the details. Face to face meetings do not provide us with all these opportunities.
If we talk about disadvantages, I do not see a lot of them. The only thing that we can miss in online communication is the ability to see human emotions and facial expressions. I find it really important, especially when it comes to discussing important projects or deals. From my own experience, I can say that when there was a lockdown in my country due to the pandemic, I missed physical interaction with my colleagues, such as handshaking, etc. I find physical interaction to be an effective way for team building, so it's might be hard to work without it, using only online communication.
To conclude, I would say that everyone can have different opinions about whether it's better to meet online or face to face. But what I am sure about is that we should not get rid of face to face meetings completely. Otherwise, It will be hard to keep the team tigh-knit.",,,,,,7.5,"As technology continues to advance, many companies now rely more on online communication than meeting in person. Personally, I see several advantages to this trend. First, online communication makes it easier for people to connect no matter where they are, which saves time and even money because people do not need to travel to the office just for one meeting. It also allows employees to work from home, which can make them feel more comfortable and possibly even more productive. There are new apps like Slack or Microsoft Teams that make it simple to discuss work, share files, and even set up group chats so people can quickly solve problems together. Despite these benefits, I do think that there are some downsides. The most important is that it can be harder to build relationships with coworkers if you only see them through a screen. Sometimes it is difficult to understand someone’s tone or feelings without seeing their body language, and this could lead to misunderstandings. Personally, after months of working online, I missed the energy of real meetings and the chance to casually chat with my teammates. In conclusion, though online communication brings a lot of convenience and saves time, I believe it is also important to have some face-to-face meetings to make sure people feel connected and to avoid miscommunication."
717,2,"In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","With the advent of the internet and later the video-call technology, life has dramatically changed, particularly in work circles as plenty of meetings have been held online rather than in offices and huge halls. In this essay, I will count the possible advantages as well as some disadvantages of such an invention and finally conclude wether or not it is really a cost-effective one.
Over the course of modern history, national and international conferrences have cost enormous funds in order to gather experts from all over the world. However, thanks to the available online communication platforms, present companies and foundations can hold meetings with famous and influencial persons more often and with less expense. Furthermore, nowadays, employees can spare the time spent on travelling between offices and premises, by having online meetings. Meetings are now recorded for documentation and any future purposes. For example, this technology has seemd to be critical on our life, specifcally since the outbreak of COVID19.

On one hand, online communication tools like instant messaging and video conferencing have transformed the way businesses operate, saving both time and money by eliminating the need for travel and allowing employees to collaborate regardless of their physical location. This flexibility can result in increased productivity, as workers are able to respond to issues swiftly and share resources with ease. Additionally, such technology makes it possible to record discussions and decisions for future reference, increasing accountability and reducing misunderstandings. However, there are drawbacks that cannot be overlooked. The absence of face-to-face contact may lead to misunderstandings or a lack of trust among colleagues, since non-verbal cues are harder to pick up through a screen. Technical issues, such as poor internet connectivity or software glitches, can disrupt the flow of important conversations or even cause missed opportunities. Moreover, reliance on online meetings may weaken the sense of community and teamwork in a workplace, making employees feel disconnected or isolated. In conclusion, while remote communication has introduced numerous advantages to modern workplaces, these must be carefully balanced against the social and technical challenges to ensure a cohesive and effective working environment."
719,2,"In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","With the advent of the internet and later the video-call technology, life has dramatically changed, particularly in work circles as plenty of meetings have been held online rather than in offices and huge halls. In this essay, I will count the possible advantages as well as some disadvantages of such an invention and finally conclude wether or not it is really a cost-effective one.
Over the course of modern history, national and international conferrences have cost enormous funds in order to gather experts from all over the world. However, thanks to the available online communication platforms, present companies and foundations can hold meetings with famous and influencial persons more often and with less expense. Furthermore, nowadays, employees can spare the time spent on travelling between offices and premises, by having online meetings. Meetings are now recorded for documentation and any future purposes. For example, this technology has seemd to be critical on our life, specifcally since the outbreak of COVID19. If humans had not have this means of communication, there would have been more severe and devastating effects on businesses.
On the other hand, there is another aspect which merits further consideration. Unfortunately, techincal network problems could still happen and cause inevitable cancellations. Moreover, meeting other colleagues merely on screens would have a detrimental social impact in workplaces. Without face-to-face interaction peers have less chance to build strong and deep relationships, which in turn might weaken co-opeartion and cohesion in any work environment.

Still, precautions should be taken to identify the possible drawbacks in order to offset their converse effects on many workplaces.",,,,,,8.0,"The rise of online communication has undeniably transformed the way employees interact in modern workplaces, shifting the focus away from traditional face-to-face meetings. On the positive side, online methods of communication have made it possible for people working in distant locations to collaborate effectively without the need for expensive and time-consuming travel. This not only saves companies a significant amount of money but also allows workers to use their time more efficiently. Furthermore, with tools that enable instant messaging and video calls, employees can respond more quickly to urgent matters and easily share documents or important information. However, these advantages are not without some drawbacks. Technical difficulties, such as internet outages or software glitches, may disrupt meetings and reduce productivity. In addition, communicating through screens often lacks the personal touch and subtle cues conveyed in person, which can lead to misunderstandings and a weaker sense of teamwork. While the potential for miscommunication is concerning, and some workers may feel isolated, the convenience and accessibility of online communication have shown to enhance flexibility and overall efficiency in most workplaces. In conclusion, although some disadvantages exist, I believe the benefits of increased accessibility, cost savings, and time efficiency mean that the positive aspects of online communication in the workplace far outweigh its negative sides."

Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","Today we live in the pandemia world, even if several countries don't have a high risk of infection for the majority of its population. We stiil sit at home rather then go to a restorant with friends and a lot of companies still keep their offices locked.
On the one hand office workers from all over the world opened the possibility of working from home. This option gives you more freedom and diversity of places from wich you can do your job: you can meet with your collegues from cafe or library, from kitchen or bedroom. Also, we were forced to keep our social nets with online tools, to communicate with our friends and families. Now we all learned to use such programmes like Zoom or Skype to speak with each other. Probably if we hadn't the Covid, we would struggle bigger difficulties when someone from our buddies would come to another country or town, but now we all know what to do with this, how to keep in touch. We also got to appreciate the power of touching more then before, because we were missing it for these long monthes. How it was nice to hug an old friend after long quarantine!
On the other hand we really weaned from normal offline communication. And we can't evaluate how many people started to think that online is absolute substitute of offline. It's obviosly not like that. During online meeting it's impossible to have a normal common discussion because it needs to have only one person speaking. Also people lack of possibility to see each others eyes, so they don't feel enough contact with each other.
As a conclusion it is possible to say that situation with increasing popularuty of online meetings is ambivalent. This type of communication save our connections with each other during the pandemia, but there is a risk of substitution real meetings by online in the situations when it is not appropriate. As far I am concerned, I think that advantages outweight disadvantages, but we need to use online communication properly.",,,,,,6.0,"It has become more and more normal for people to talk to each other online at work instead of meeting in person. There are a few good things about this change. First, online communication saves a lot of time, since you do not have to travel anywhere for meetings and you can quickly share information using email or messaging apps. Second, online meetings make it easier for people from different cities or even countries to work together, so companies can hire the best workers no matter where they are. However, there are also several problems. It is harder to understand each other when you only see someone on a screen because you miss things like body language or small facial expressions. Sometimes, people feel more lonely working from home because they do not get to talk with their coworkers face to face, which can make work less enjoyable. Also, internet problems can make it difficult to have a smooth conversation. In conclusion, I think the good things about online communication at work are stronger than the bad things, but we should not forget that sometimes face-to-face meetings are still important for teamwork and understanding each other."
723,2,Some educationalists say that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Education is one of the most important topics for childhood development, and music can be very beneficial to children because it helps to sustain creative thinking and improve imagination. Some educators demand that music should be taught as a mandatory subject, and yet some others think that forcing children to play music instruments will limit their chances to discover and develop other talents.
Indeed, music can be a great source for improving the lives of many children as well as their learning experience. Learning music instruments requires patience, creativity and good discipline. Inherently, in order to master a music instrument, a good musician needs to sharpen his preserverence and offer all his best, for a great performance often demands ten or more years of practice. The heart of a musician, the pursuation of perfection and persistence are all good qualities for a child to learn throughout his life in pursuing his career, not only the career in music.
However, despite all the good qualities that can be obtained through playing music instruments, childhood education can be misdirected if the development of a hobbie becomes ""mandatory"", which, of ocurse, includes music instruments. It might be beneficial for a child to experiment music instruments in his early years, but not every child has the potential of being a professional musician. Making music a mandatory subject for primary and secondary school students could minimize their opportunities to discover different hobbies. Moreover, making a bobbie a mandatory subject may also hinder the other learning experiences of a young child. Just imagine how stressful it is to study an unecessary subject on top of regular courses and other homework. It does more harms than goods to the overall learning experience.
In conclusion, it might be beneficial for a child to learn music instruments in his first school years, but if he does not have the talent and does not enjoy music, educators should consider dropping such suggestion and let him discover other hobbies.",,,,,,7.5,"There are differing opinions on whether every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument, and both sides present valid arguments. Supporters of music education claim that learning an instrument has numerous cognitive and social benefits for children. For example, playing music can help to develop concentration, memory, and problem-solving skills. It also encourages patience and self-discipline because mastering an instrument takes consistent practice and determination. In addition, participating in music groups such as a school band or orchestra can foster teamwork and communication skills among students. On the other hand, making music instruction compulsory for all children may not be the best approach for fostering individual growth. Everyone has distinct interests and strengths, and not every child finds music appealing or rewarding. Forcing uninterested children to practice an instrument could cause unnecessary stress, take valuable time away from subjects and activities they might excel in, and ultimately dampen their enthusiasm for learning. In my opinion, while the advantages of learning an instrument are significant and schools should offer opportunities for musical education, it should not be a universal requirement. Instead, children should be encouraged to try music, but allowed to pursue their own passions and talents as they grow."
725,2,Some educationalists say that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is commonly known that music has always played an important role in upbringing of children and a lot of parents wish their kids play a musical instrument. However, I disagree that this skill is essential to every pupil.
First of all, not all people are born with a talent for music, which is essential if one wants to learn how to play it. Some people are natural musicians and succeed in this sphere with ease. On the other hand, there are children for whom learning to play is a hard work and, eventually, they might start hating music instead of enjoying it. Some people are bound to become excellent engineers or doctors and for them learning to read and play music is just a waste of time.
Another important factor is that all kids are different and for that reason each of them desires to have a different hobby. If all pupils spent time on music, those who are not interested in it would have less time on things that are really exciting for them. Undoubtedly, everybody has a right to spend their free time in the way they want.
What is more, playing a musical instrument is not considered to be an essential skill for a successful career. More time should be devoted to more important subjects, such as Math, Science and Languages. These have more chance to be useful for people when they grow up and graduate from school.
To sum up, teaching all children to play an instrument wouldn't be a good idea. It should be taught only to those who really want it as not only would it ditract a child from subjects and hobbies which are more important in their opinion, but also it cannot be mastered by everybody.",,,,,,6.5,"While many people believe that music is an important part of education, I do not think that every student must be required to learn a musical instrument. Firstly, not all children have a strong interest in music and some may struggle greatly with learning an instrument, which could lead to frustration and even lower their confidence in school. Every child has unique abilities and passions, and forcing everyone to learn an instrument could limit the time they have to develop their true talents, whether those lie in sports, arts, science, or other areas. For some, spending the same amount of effort on learning a new language or improving their math skills could be much more valuable for their future. Additionally, while music can provide benefits like improved concentration and creativity, these skills can also be developed through other activities that may suit certain children better. Making learning an instrument compulsory may take away the joy of music for some and reduce their freedom to choose what they want to pursue. Overall, while music is important, I think it should be offered as an option rather than a requirement, so that children can decide for themselves how they want to spend their time and energy."

Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. In the following paragraph, I will discuss both view and give my opinion.
On the one hands, There has a research that bad experience in children before begining at school, especcially in family, will become unforgettable deep heart. For example, Children who live with strict parents and has aggressive punishment when children doing littie wrong things. In the future, Children will tend to aggressive and feeling they has not received a love from family. This research surely reasonnable because family is an important factor of social life.
On the other hands, There have an opinion even if children was velvet glove when raised with family. However, Especially in adolescent, Friend and teacher can infleuence as same as family because teenagers spend more time at school that with family as a reason learning in classroom more than primary school and have a more group work with friend. Thus, If teenager prefer to close with a good student (not smoking or drinking alcohol / invite classroom friends travel education museum in weekends or holiday), Parents can make sure that your child will mature to standard adults.
In conclusion, In my opinion, Children would be infleuenced by family before begining at school. After that, They will has a lot of complex relationship in school from friends and teachers that can infleuences children. So, Children should try to control yourself in moral to be a best quality adults.",,,,,,5.5,"There is a debate about which part of life has the biggest effect on a person's future: childhood before starting school or the teenage years, especially during school. On one side, some people believe that what happens to us as very young children, like family life and early learning, shapes who we become. For example, young children who grow up in a caring family usually learn important values and become confident. Bad experiences, such as being ignored or treated harshly, can cause problems that last for many years. On the other side, some people think that the teenage years in school have more influence because teenagers begin to make their own choices and are more independent from their families. Teenagers often spend more time with classmates and teachers, so good friends and positive experiences at school can help someone become successful and responsible. In my own view, I believe both stages are important, but experiences before school are the most powerful because they build the basic character and rules for life. After that, teenagers can improve and grow, but what they learned early makes the biggest difference in who they are as adults."

At all both stages or experiences even as a child or as a teenager will have an impact and influence on the human future with different demenssions.

Some believe that a child's early years are the foundation for everything that follows, as this is when family relationships, basic values, and emotional development are shaped, and these factors can determine future confidence and worldview. Others argue that the teenage years, particularly the time spent at school, are more important because this is when individuals are exposed to new ideas, peer influence increases, and they make important decisions about their career paths. In addition, teens face challenges that can teach them responsibility, independence, and how to deal with complex social situations. Personally, I think that both childhood and teenage experiences are equally important because each stage helps shape different aspects of a person's character and abilities. Early childhood experiences build the base, and the teenage years add layers that prepare people for adult life. Therefore, having positive and supportive experiences in both stages can most strongly affect a person’s future."
731,2,"Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential.

Some people hold that the pre-school life is the most influential, while others disagree and claim that the teenage life, notably the period of staying at school, would be more important to his/her life. This essay is to evaluate both views and demonstrate my opinion.
Before entering the school, children usually receive the most influence from their parents and friends. At home, children would spend much time with their parents teaching them a variety of knowledge needed to help an adolescent act properly and get recognised by the society in the future. When staying outside, children would also be influenced by their friends or other peers since children tend to resemble the behaviours of their peers in order to integrate into the social group of adolescents.
In the school life, a child's personality would be shaped both by classmates who frequently interact with the child and potentially affect the child, and by teachers presenting knowledge in various fields of science and liberal arts so as to help the child obtain a basic understanding to the world.
As far as I am concerned, it is rather arbitrary to conclude which period of life would be more important than the other, since a child's psychological development is too complex to be understood. After all, the importance of pre-school life or teenage period might vary from one child to another. Children have their respective understandings as to which person deserves their admiration and which period of life teaches them the best lesson.
To sum up, children would be influenced by different persons in different periods of life. It depends on children's own intention as to which period is more pivotal, and which person should be admired.",,,,,,7.5,"There are differing opinions about which period in a person's early life is the most decisive for their future development. Some argue that the years before entering school are the most important, while others believe that the teenage years, particularly those spent at school, have a greater effect. In the early years, children are mainly shaped by their families, who teach them values, social norms, and basic life skills. Parents, relatives, and close friends can strongly influence a child's personality and outlook on life before formal education begins. On the other hand, the time spent as a teenager, especially within the school environment, adds a new layer of influence, as adolescents interact with a variety of peers and are exposed to new ideas and academic challenges. Teachers and classmates can provide inspiration and guide teenagers as they develop their identities and plan for their futures. In my view, both periods are significant but in different ways, and it is hard to say one is more influential than the other. The early childhood years lay the foundation, but it is during the teenage years that young people actively build on that foundation and make choices that shape their adult lives. Therefore, each stage has its unique importance in influencing a person’s future."

In this essay will disscuss on both point of view and will show some supportive opinions that experiences during the time at school are highly impact futher development in the future for many teenagers.
On one hand, it is the fact that experiences or events happend during their childhood or before they starting to go to school can highly attached to their memories. For example, children would be able to remember the situation where they felt the most insecure or scared, for example, some scary movies or fear of some animals. In which will be further more becomes their wound in their heart. However, these experiences can be erradicated or overcame after in their life and left with just some funny moments for them in the future.

On the other hand, there are higher varieties of experiences occurred during teenage stage of life, in which are more recognizable both from an external factors like their friends, family or their environments in school. And also from their individuals experiences, for example, teenagers are able to realize some of the failure or mistakes that happened in their life such as their examinations failure. In addition to that, some of events might able to happend during the teenages time only, for example, their first love or their first boyfriend/girlfriend.

For instance, feeling loved and safe at home before school can help someone grow up to be happier and more secure. On the other hand, many insist that the experiences during the teenage years are more powerful because teenagers face bigger challenges, learn important lessons from friends and teachers, and deal with responsibilities such as exams and making choices about their future. At this age, young people often form opinions about themselves and make decisions that can last a lifetime.

Some people argue that those experiences which a child faces before entering into school has more effect, whereas others believe that teenhood has profound influence on a child's future life. This essay will discuss in detail both the views and explain why i believe that both early childhood and teenage experiences decide what future holds for the child.
Those people, who are in opinion that experiences in early childhood before the start of school has impact on future life, give several reasons. They believe that whatever a child faces at home helps in shaping his personality. For example, abusive childhood greatly has long lasting effect on their lives. It has been studied that those children who are victims of child abuse are more likely to become criminals. Some of them can never return towards normal life. Moreover, parents by their care and love can raise a child with a bright future. These children know the world from the perspective of their parents and it helps them to become a well-mannered and cultured human being with specific life goals, such as getting higher education or finding a job. In short, early childhood has its far reaching effects on a child.
On the other hand, people, who think that teenage experiences , especially at school, have more impact on determining the future of the person, have their own reasons to support their argument. Firstly, it is the phase of life where hormonal changes are taking place and they are experiencing body changes both mentally and physically; therefore, those who can have control on their emotions during this phase can develop as a strong individual. Secondly, it is the phase where most of the teenagers start taking decisions about their future study choices and any study experience at school help them in making these decisions. Such resolutions in teenage can have impact on their future practical lives. Finally, those youngsters, who are bullied during their teenhood at school, can suffer from personality disorder later in their lives which can have detrimental affect on their future. Surely, these experiences in teenage can affect a child's future.

It is the experiences in both of these phases of lives which influence a child's future.",,,,,,7.5,"The stage of life that most shapes a child’s future has always been debated, with some saying that a child’s earliest experiences before school are most important, while others argue that it is their teenage years, especially time spent in school, that are more influential. Those who believe early childhood is most significant often point out that this is when a child’s basic personality and emotional responses are formed. Children who receive love, attention, and good examples from their families often grow up with greater self-confidence and healthier relationships. On the other hand, negative experiences or neglect during these years can lead to long-lasting emotional struggles or trouble fitting into society. Conversely, supporters of the view that the teenage years are more critical highlight that during this period, young people gain more independence and start making important life choices, such as what subjects to study and what career to pursue. The relationships they build with teachers and friends at school, as well as the challenges they overcome, can leave a deep mark on their character and ambitions. For instance, a supportive teacher or a strong group of friends can inspire someone to reach their full potential, whereas negative experiences like bullying or peer pressure can damage self-esteem and future prospects. In conclusion, I believe that both early childhood and teenage experiences play crucial roles in shaping a person's future, as each phase presents unique challenges and opportunities that influence who we become."

The most significant advatage of learning to grow vegetables is that children will initally start to understand the importance of eating healthy and also the process of growing vegetables. In this case children will learn not to waste food and how hard and the effort it takes to grow these vegetables. It is important that we keep reminding children from their primary age so that they will remember and practice as they grow older. Taking care of animals is another important thing that children should learn in their primary , this will teach children to care for others and not be frighten of animals. Furthermore, they will learn to respect animals and love them.
Some of the disadvantages of keeping animals is that some children has different types of allergies which will lead them to be more sick. However, some animals tend to be more dangerous than others. Another disadvatages is that when growing vegetables the compost and pestisides are dangerous to children or it might sometime be allergic to them as well. Insect bites during planting will also lead children to get sick.
In conclusion it is important to learn how to grow vegetables and take care of animals at their younger age since they develop certain habits and learn more indeapth which will be helpful as they grow older. Eventhough, some argue that it is more riskier for children I believe that the advatages outweight disadvatages.",,,,,,5.0,"Teaching primary school children to grow vegetables and look after animals is a subject that has both positives and negatives, but I believe the advantages are more important. Firstly, when children learn how to grow vegetables, they start to understand where their food comes from and appreciate the effort involved in producing it, which can help them to avoid wasting food and to eat more healthily. Looking after animals also helps children to become more responsible because they learn that living things need daily care and attention. This can help develop their sense of compassion and make them more patient and kind in their relationships with other people. Of course, there are some risks, like children possibly getting allergies from animals or being exposed to dirt and bugs while gardening. Also, not all children may have access to a safe environment to practice these activities. However, if teachers and parents make sure safety is a priority, these risks can be controlled. In conclusion, I believe that letting primary children learn to grow plants and care for animals will teach them valuable skills and life lessons, and therefore, the advantages strongly outweigh the disadvantages."
743,2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"In primary school, especially in the countryside in Japan, primary students have an opportunity to learn how to plant and grow vegetables. In addition, students need to feed and observe animal growth and health. This is a great advantage for children to enrich their knowledge of how essential our lives consist in society. It is obviously advantageous than disadvantages.
Firstly, the procedures to grow vegetables take a long time from cultivating the soil to harvesting vegetables when they grew up. This means that it is great education for children on how to produce our food and agriculture industries have been paying an outstanding effort and time. This education causes students to become aware of the necessity of gratitude to people who are working in these industries.
In addition, it is also mandatory to keep animals in a good condition is worthwhile as young as possible. Animals also have lives, and their lives easily devastate unless they are fed. This is also the same in human lives. Young children will be able to recognize how sensitive to keeping animals a good condition, and be more respectful to their own parents and how deep love they give to children. As a result they are more willing to give a hand who need help.
Finally, these activities, such as growing vegetables and keeping animals are not only helpful to learn what our society consists of, but also more educational for children firsthand, instead of watching documental TV programs. Through these activities, children will become aware of current issues, for example, food consumerism, extinction of animal species, global warming, and so on. If they learned as young as possible, the number of people who are concerned and make specific actions for these issues will increase. As a result, our lifestyle will improve more peacefully.
動物　繊細に状況を観察していいコンディションを保つことの大切さを知る。それは人にも共通しているため、世話を通じて親に対する感謝や、友人に対して暖かい言葉をかけることができるようになる。",,,,,,5.5,"Having primary school children learn to grow vegetables and look after animals provides significant educational benefits that outweigh any possible disadvantages. First, these activities give students a hands-on understanding of the origins of their food, teaching them patience as they plant, tend, and eventually harvest produce. By putting effort into the process, children develop respect for farmers and the hard work involved in providing food for society. Similarly, caring for animals helps children realize that all living things require attention and responsibility, which can increase their empathy towards others and help them become more caring individuals. These real-life experiences are far more memorable and impactful than simply reading about nature in textbooks or watching videos. Although it can be argued that taking care of plants and animals requires time and supervision from teachers, the lessons about teamwork, gratitude, and the importance of environmental stewardship are invaluable. Ultimately, learning these skills early in life can nurture a deeper sense of responsibility and connection to the world around them, making the advantages far greater than any disadvantages."
745,2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"Some people believe that young children ought to breed animals and plant vegetables. This essay will argue about some pros and cons of children working as farmers, and also show that disadvantages overtake the benefits of it.
One the one hand, it is a fact that young children who work looking after animals and plants learn how to respect the environment and develop an elevated sense of responsability. Certainly, activities such as taking care of animals and grow vegetables favour children in many aspects of their lives, like to have a better health, mostly because of doing lots of outdoor activities and eating healthier food than city children.
On the other hand, if children learn how to work as a farmer, they could try to do it alone, without any supervision, which is surely a hard work, with a lot of difficult and responsabilties. In order words, those tasks could be dangerous to a child and affect negatively its live. For example, it is necessary to use some special tools to deal with vegetables, and those tools could harm easily a child. In addition, looking after animals and plants take too much time and children must spend their time studying and having fun instead of working.
In conclusion, although the benefits that people can find in teaching young children to deal with animals and grow vegetables, the disadvantanges of children doing those tasks are extremely high, because of some permanent damages which could be caused by dangerous tools. In my opinion, young children should learn how to do it but they must not do those activities even if they were supervised by adults.",,,,,,5.5,"Some educators think that primary school students should gain experience in farming by learning to grow vegetables and care for animals. There are benefits and drawbacks to this suggestion. On the positive side, involving children in these activities can help them develop important life skills, such as patience, responsibility, and an understanding of nature. This hands-on learning can also encourage healthy habits, as children may be more willing to eat the vegetables they have grown themselves and spend more time outdoors. However, there are significant disadvantages as well. Children may not be physically or emotionally mature enough for the demanding tasks of animal care and gardening, and without close supervision, they could risk injury from farming tools or unpredictable animal behavior. Additionally, the time needed for these activities could take away from studying and rest, which are essential for young learners. In conclusion, while teaching primary children about farming offers some valuable lessons, the potential risks and time constraints mean the disadvantages overshadow the benefits. Therefore, I believe these activities should be introduced with caution and never take priority over children’s safety and academic needs."
747,2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"Nowadays, it is widely believed that education has become an important aspect of our lives, especially for primary children, which have to be well educated before achieving the period of adolescence. Furthermore, I hold on firmly to the belief that, children should learn how to respect the environment, especially the agriculture such as vegetables and the wildlife as animals.
To begin with, children should learn how to cultivate and grow vegetables, in order to respect the environment. In other words, children may experience some extra activities related to plants cultivation during or after school. For instance, educational institutions could organise some apprenticeship activities and teach how to cultivate and grow vegetables. In addition to this, it often claimed that taking part in these types of activities may develop children's skills and acquiring leadership skills. Moreover, young students could experience different types of cultivation, in order to gain knowledge of agriculture sector. Therefore, these may be useful for children's career prospects and for their future.
Secondly, another vital aspect of our world that should be considered is the wildlife, especially there some animals endangered. In other words, animals have become significant for the world's ecosystems and useful for companionship. For example, it is generally agreed that children may have to learn how to maintain animals. Additionally, children could experience activities in animals protection associations, in order to learn how to keep and protect animals with the support of some volunteers. As a result, children when they grow up are aware to the fact that animals are important and have to be always appreciated and respected.
In conclusion, as far as I'm concerned, the advantages of learning how to cultivate vegetables and keep animals definitely outweigh the drawbacks. Additionally, there is no doubt that children doing these activities may gain many positive experiences, develop their skills and learn how value and appreciate the environment including wildlife.",,,,,,7.5,"In recent years, there has been growing support for the idea that primary school children should gain practical experience by learning how to grow vegetables and take care of animals. Personally, I strongly believe that the advantages of this kind of education far surpass any possible disadvantages. To begin with, allowing young students to engage in gardening and animal care can foster a greater appreciation for nature and environmental stewardship. For instance, when children learn about planting seeds, observing plant growth, or looking after small animals, they gain hands-on knowledge that cannot be acquired from textbooks alone, which may also help them understand where food comes from and develop healthy eating habits. Additionally, such activities can encourage responsibility, teamwork, and patience, as students must work together to tend their gardens or share the duties of caring for animals. Critics might argue that these activities could take time away from more academic pursuits, or pose difficulties for schools with limited resources. However, the life skills children develop during these experiences, such as problem-solving and compassion, are just as valuable as traditional subjects, and can even enrich their academic learning by making subjects like science more engaging and accessible. Ultimately, I am convinced that the benefits of teaching primary children to grow vegetables and keep animals not only outweigh the negatives but also contribute significantly to their overall personal and academic development."
749,2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"It is proposed that elementary schools should teach their pupils vegetable growing and animal keeping skills. Although there are controversial views towards this proposal, I believe that its benefits outweigh its drawback for a range of reasons stated below.
On the one hand, experiences of vegetable growning and animals keeping can help children develop some first hand knowledge and some key characters that would benefit them in the long run. Firstly, by involving in the process of vegetables growing, children gain in-depth understanding of the nature and its impact on the development of a life cycle. In this case, they are capable of learning some practiacal knowledge regarding how weather and seasons could either foster or destruct the growth of plants. Secondly, keeping pets or other animals can encourage the deveopment of the pupils' responsibility. As they learn how to rountinely feed animals, and take showers for them, their responsbility and empathy also grow hand in hand, which would lay a solid foundation for their future study, family life and professional career.
On the other hand, it may be argued that taking such courses could distact students from their intensive study. It is not necessarily true because the aforementioned knwledge and skills can be transferble to their academic study and social life in schools. For example, their first hand experiences of growing vegetables can advance their understanding of some theoretical knowledge about plants in the bilogy class. The empathy deveoped through raising animlas could be also taken advantage to strengthen relationships with teachers and peers.
In conclusion, it is understandable that some people oppose the idea of the pupils learning vegetables growing and animals keeping, but I strongly think that its advantages outweigh the disadvantages.",,,,,,7.5,"It has been suggested that teaching primary children how to cultivate vegetables and care for animals should form part of the school curriculum. While there are concerns that such activities may interfere with academic studies and require additional resources, I believe the advantages are more significant. Firstly, engaging children in gardening and animal care provides them with valuable hands-on experiences, deepening their understanding of natural sciences in ways that classroom theory alone cannot achieve. Observing plant growth or animal behavior firsthand can make biology lessons more meaningful and memorable. Secondly, these activities instill essential life skills, such as patience and responsibility, which not only aid academic success but also contribute to character development. For instance, caring for animals requires regular feeding and cleaning, teaching children to be diligent and empathetic towards other living beings. Although some might argue that time and resources spent on such programs could distract from core subjects, the skills gained are transferable and ultimately help improve students’ engagement and relationships both in and out of school. Therefore, I firmly believe that the educational and emotional benefits of involving primary children in vegetable growing and animal care far outweigh any potential disadvantages."
751,2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"It is advised that toddlers should learn about growing vegetables and raising animals. Although there are downsides to this proposal, the overall advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages in this matter.
The main advantage of teaching the younger generation how to farm vegetables and keeping animals is that it can enhance their understanding of the environment. There is no doubt that school kids could learn about the environment on books, but the most effective way is to interact with the habitation of vegetables and animals as they can easily be related with. In addition, by learning about foods and animals, children could quickly develop their awareness of not wasting food. Only when children realize how difficult and complicated it is to nurture food, can they stop wasting food or throwing food they dislike. For instance, public schools in Melbourne developed a targeted curriculum to supporting primary children to learn about the growth of foods and the significance of preserving the environment and reduce food waste. Hence, the advantage is obvious since younger pupils must recognise the world they live in.
However, it is suggested that the physical risk of allowing primary offspring to learn about farming could not be overlooked. One of the root disadvantages of caring for animals is the safety issue as animals might have potentially harmful effects on young kids. To elaborate, there is a mixture of the hidden virus on animals' bodies, due to the fragility of children's immune systems, they are too vulnerable to defend against external viruses, not to even mention the physical attack from animals to children. According to the agricultural department, there are 300 cases of animals attacking children reported every year in China, which could be considered as a piece of strong evidence of the disadvantages.
In conclusion, despite the potential drawbacks of learning about animals and floras, the benefits of involving young toddlers in discovering about the environment still outweigh the downside.",,,,,,8.0,"It is often proposed that young children should be introduced to gardening and animal care from an early age. Although there are certain drawbacks to this suggestion, I believe the benefits far outnumber the disadvantages. Involving children in growing vegetables and looking after animals can help them develop important life skills and a sense of responsibility. When primary students participate in planting seeds or feeding small animals, they learn patience, teamwork, and how daily actions impact living things. This can foster a deeper appreciation for nature and healthier eating habits, as children are more likely to eat vegetables they have grown themselves. Furthermore, school garden projects, such as those implemented in many primary schools in Japan, have shown to improve students’ attitudes toward both food and their community. Nevertheless, some concerns remain, such as the increased risk of allergies or minor injuries, and the additional supervision required from teachers. Critics also point out the logistical challenges, especially for urban schools with limited space. However, these issues can often be mitigated through proper safety guidelines and creative use of classroom gardens or indoor plant kits. In summary, while there are certain risks and obstacles associated with teaching young children to grow vegetables and care for animals, the overall educational and developmental advantages make it a beneficial practice."
753,2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"Nowadays a lot of primary schools are starting to introduce the teaching of animal care and general agriculture. Many people think that primary children should study and understand how to grow vegetables and keep animals; this essay will discuss why primary school should learn about this two arguments and how the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
It is very important study and understand how to grow vegetables and how to keep animals, especially in a younger age. Most of the kids, that frequent the primary school, have this desire of having a pet and, the opportunity of studying how to take care of it in the school, can make the child more aware of the responsibilities that he will have if, one day, he has to own one of them. At the same time, for a primary children it's also important to understand how vegetables grown and what's the process behind that , learning about this arguments will help the kids to appreciate more the food and, as a consequence, in the future there will be less waste of it .
It's clear that the advantages will be more than the disadvantages, if there are any. If every kid will know more about the arguments, the world in the future will become a better place, with more respect for the animals and more appreciation for the vegetables that, will also help people to make a healthier life.
In conclusion, this essay discussed on how the introduction of subjects like animal care and general understanding of how vegetables grow, will help the kids to become better adults in the future to make of this world a better place.",,,,,,7.0,"In recent years, teaching children in primary school about growing vegetables and caring for animals has become more common. Many people believe that these activities are valuable in a child's education, and this essay will examine whether the benefits are greater than any possible drawbacks. Firstly, learning how to grow vegetables gives children practical knowledge about where their food comes from, and encourages them to make healthier eating choices while also taking responsibility for the environment. Similarly, being involved in caring for animals teaches empathy and respect for living things, skills that are important in forming kind and responsible citizens. Although some argue that these activities could take time away from traditional academic subjects like mathematics and reading, the hands-on experiences can actually support those subjects, for instance by making science lessons more engaging and understandable. Furthermore, not all schools may have enough space or resources for gardens or animal care, but even small-scale projects can offer valuable lessons. Overall, the positive effects of learning to grow food and care for animals—such as increased awareness, responsibility, and appreciation for nature—significantly outweigh any disadvantages, helping children to become more thoughtful and capable adults."
755,2,It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"Throughout history, adult people have been those who worked on farms and they also were responsible for breeding animals. Recently, it has been suggested that kids in elementary schools should also take part in such occupations. In this essay, I will count possible advantages as well as some disadvantages of such a change in life, in order to conclude whether or not it is a cost effective notion.
It is commonly believed that the enviroment has been endangered by imminent risks. Some people speculate that humans have been less connected to nature and therefore are not aware of the detrimental effects of their activities on the environment. Thus, teaching children how to raise up vegetables and how to get along with pets can probably strengthen bonds between children and nature in early phases of life. Furthermore, If children grew plants in early stage of life, they would develop unique creative skills alongside enhancing their productivity. Moreover, some experts claim that treating animals may benefit children as it would improve their social and communicational skills.
On the other hand, there is another aspect which merits futher consideration. Some plants are known to be poisonous and unsafe to young people. In addition, growing plants and spending time on farms might make children prone to a few insects and reptiles which can be really dangerous. Finally, animals could be harmful if they are treated inappropriately.
To recapitulate, as we try to wiegh up the pros and cons of such an enterprise, I still reckon that the advantages of it outweigh the disadvantages. However, in order guarantee the possible advantages I have mentioned upun above, certain safety measures should be taken to offset the potential risks opposed to children as they are in proximity to plants and animals.",,,,,,7.5,"In recent years, there has been increasing discussion about whether primary school students should be taught how to cultivate vegetables and care for animals as part of their education. Advocates of this idea claim that introducing children to agriculture and animal husbandry promotes a deeper understanding of food sources, encourages healthy eating habits, and nurtures a sense of responsibility through the act of caring for living things. Additionally, such practical learning experiences may foster teamwork, patience, and respect for the environment. However, there are also notable drawbacks to this proposal. Young children may lack the maturity or the physical capability to manage certain tasks safely, and improper handling of animals or plants might lead to accidental injuries or exposure to harmful substances. Furthermore, incorporating these activities into an already crowded curriculum could reduce the focus on essential academic subjects. Despite these concerns, I believe that the educational and personal development benefits associated with learning to grow vegetables and keep animals ultimately outweigh the disadvantages, provided that schools implement adequate supervision and safety guidelines to minimize any potential risks."
757,2,Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children's development than playing computer games. This essay will elaborate a point of agreement to the above statement.
To commence with the first reason, outdoor activities are good for children's health. As children run and play with ones' friends, outdoor activities will apparently relieve the stress. Furthermore, it is scientifically proven that an exercise is beneficial for all mankind as it is recommended by the doctors and scientists. For instance, doctors encourage the patients who have non-communicable diseases, known as lifestyle illnesses, to exercise more. Thus, it will prevent children from getting illnesses.
Additionally, spending time with one's friends will definitely help a child to build a healthy relationship with others. As a child learns universal values and realizes important aspects of life, it will greatly influence the way a child will live one's life. For example, a child can learn sportsmanship while playing sports with his or her friend.
On the other hand, playing computer games can lead a child to be addicted with electronic gadgets. Addiction is one of the most risky things which may put one's life into a pit. If a computer game consists of violent or aggressive contents within it, a child may get influenced. There are a great number of reports and thesis which focus on how computer games affect the children's behaviour in a negative way.
Moreover, electrical gadgets affect one's eyesight. Nowdays, as most of people are exposed to the lights from the devices, it can be easily proven that there are more people with glasses comparing to the past. Using a computer for a short period of time is not risky, however, using a computer for a long time for certain purposes, even if it is for research work, it will affect one's eyesight badly.
To conclude, it is proven that outdoor activities are more beneficial than playing computer games. Therefore, communities, parents, and teachers ought to encourage children to do outdoor activities rather than ordering a child be sitted for a long time, the act which causes unhealthiness.",,,,,,5.5,"Some people believe that outdoor activities hold more advantages for children's development than engaging with computer games. This essay will present points supporting this view. Firstly, outdoor activities encourage physical fitness among young people. When children play outside, whether running, jumping, or cycling, they strengthen their muscles and bones, while also reducing the risk of obesity and related illnesses. Medical experts consistently recommend daily physical activity for children to promote healthy growth and prevent disease. In addition, outdoor play supports social skill development. Children who participate in group sports or playground games have more opportunities to communicate, cooperate, and resolve conflicts with peers, which are valuable skills for their future. Conversely, playing computer games for long hours can lead to addiction and social isolation. Sedentary lifestyles caused by excessive gaming may result in poor health, such as back pain or eye strain due to screen exposure. Moreover, many video games contain violent content, which some studies suggest can negatively influence children's behavior and increase aggression. Although computer games can improve certain abilities like strategic thinking or hand-eye coordination, the benefits of outdoor activities for children’s health and social development are far greater. Therefore, it is essential for parents and teachers to encourage children to participate in outdoor activities whenever possible, ensuring a more balanced and beneficial upbringing."
759,2,Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Children's Development is one of the most priorities for most of the parents and they want to ensure that their children get all the needed interventions for their children's progress. Some people think that playing outside provide more benefits compared to playing computer games. As a child who experienced both, I agree that playing outside is more beneficial.
Outdoor activities give children the opportunity to show and enhance their physical, mental, and social abilities. If a child plays in the park, he tends to explore different parts of the field by running or walking, and this develops his physical health. Joining a camping could help a kid develop his problem-solving skills, making him use his basic knowledge about the activity. A kid can also meet different children on a playground, with the same wave-length as his, and this allows him develop to be sociable to others.
On the other hand, computer games also gives kids a chance to develop their mental capabilities to the point that some get addicted playing it. Another disadvantage is it does not enable children to enhance their physical development. Other computer games offer problem-solving activities, logics, and reasoning, making children to exercise their cognitive abilities. Some games overstimulate the brain, to the point that a player can get hooked and addicted to it to play long hours. In addition, most of the computer games are not physically interactive, and let the players sit during the entire game. This would not benefit children to develop their muscles.
Although computer games could benefit children mentally but it has different disadvantages that outweighs the advantage of it. Children could develop more should they spend more time outside as it provides a chance for them to exercise, explore, and socialize to different children. These reasons brought me to agree on the statement on this task.",,,,,,7.0,"Many parents are concerned about the best way to help their children grow and develop, leading to the debate about whether outdoor activities or computer games are more beneficial. In my opinion, outdoor activities provide children with a broader range of advantages for their development compared to playing computer games. Being outside allows children to move their bodies, which is important for building physical health, such as stronger muscles and better coordination. Outdoor play also gives kids a chance to interact with others face-to-face, which improves their social skills and teaches them how to cooperate and communicate. Activities like team sports or simple games in a park can also teach important lessons about fair play and dealing with both winning and losing. On the other hand, computer games do offer some mental benefits, like practicing problem-solving and quick thinking, but they mainly keep children indoors and can lead to unhealthy habits like inactivity and excessive screen time. Sometimes computer games even cause children to become less interested in real-life friendships or physical activities. I believe that while technology is part of modern life, the overall benefits of being outdoors make a bigger positive impact on children's physical, social, and emotional development. Therefore, I agree that outdoor activities are generally more beneficial for children’s growth than playing computer games."
761,2,Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Children’s development is very essential. It can decide whether children will grow up to be a better people or not. Many people think outdoor activities are more useful for children’s development compared with playing computer games. For me, I strongly agree with this view and wil give my reasons in the essay below.
The main reason that I agree with this statement is about socializing. Everyone knows that humans are social animals. That means they cannot live alone in society, especially kids. Outdoor activities can help them to talk with other people or play with other kids, including making friends. Moreover, childhood is the age of learning something new. They will learn something new all the time from us which can make them have a good attitude when they grow up. While playing games make themes lost of self-awareness for surrounding. As a result, outdoor activities teach children to be a good socializing
Another reason that I hold this view is about health. As I talk in the previous paragraph, childhood is the age of not only learning something new but also trying. Outdoor activities in terms of sports such as football or basketball can help not only connect with other kids but also make them healthy. Compared with playing computer inside their room which makes them diminish and hurt their eyesight. As it can be, children will have a good physical health form outdoor activities.
In conclusion, I strongly agree that adults should support their child with outdoor activities for the purpose of socializing and good physical health.",,,,,,6.0,"Children’s development is a very important topic for parents and teachers to consider. Some people believe outdoor activities are much better for children than playing computer games, and I also strongly agree with this point of view for several reasons. First, outdoor activities help children improve their communication skills and build friendships because they have to cooperate and interact with others in sports or group games. This teaches them how to work with people and express their ideas in a friendly way. Second, being outdoors allows children to get exercise and fresh air, which are both essential for a healthy body and mind. Playing computer games for hours often leads to health problems like poor eyesight and a lack of physical fitness. Third, outdoor activities give children opportunities to explore their environment and learn new skills, such as riding a bicycle or playing football, which can boost their confidence and independence. On the other hand, while some computer games might help with problem-solving skills, they cannot replace the real-life experiences and health benefits that outdoor activities provide. In conclusion, I believe that outdoor activities are more beneficial than computer games for children’s development, both for their social and physical well-being."
763,2,Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some groups of society are having the idea that outdoor activities are vital for children to improve their mental and physical skills rather than gaming. In my opinion, I agree that crafts and physical interaction between kids are essential for their development in all aspects. Modern technology which contains computer games may have negative effects on their overall development.
The reason why I believe that such activities are important is that kids are building their personalities during the first years of their life, and this building process requires them to play and interact with their peers in real-life situations which without any doubt can not be done through online games that do not offer this rich experience to them. For example, when a child faces her friends and communicates with them face to face doing some activities, she will learn from them things that will contribute to her growth in many ways.
In addition to that reason, outdoor activities offer authentic exposure to different situations which helps children to learn how to deal and manage their actions which will increase their awareness, on the other hand, computer games can not provide the exposure that may be needed to achieve such benefits. To illustrate, children who play outside their houses with their mates generally will give a specific and quick response to different situations in contrast with those who spend hours infront of computer screens.
In conclusion, outdoor activities are valuable for what they give to children, not only for their personalities to be formed and developed, but also for their understanding to multiple real-life situations.",,,,,,8.5,"Many individuals suggest that spending time outdoors brings more advantages to children’s growth than sitting indoors and playing computer games. I mostly agree with this idea because outdoor activities tend to help children develop both physically and socially in ways that computer games cannot. Engaging in sports, playing in the park, or even exploring nature enables children to improve their coordination, strengthen their bodies, and experience face-to-face social interactions which are important for learning communication and teamwork. Meanwhile, computer games are mostly sedentary, and excessive screen time can lead to negative health effects such as poor eyesight and lack of physical exercise. Furthermore, while computer games can offer some benefits such as improved problem-solving skills or quick thinking, they usually do not allow children to practice their social skills in real scenarios or to develop emotional intelligence as effectively as playing outdoors with friends. In essence, although computer games may be entertaining and sometimes educational, I believe children gain more significant life skills and healthier development by participating in outdoor activities."
765,2,Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some individuals believe that playing outside has a more positive effect on children's development rather than playing computer games. I share the idea that being involved in outdoor activities is more beneficial than playing computer games.
Active development is the main reason for including outdoor activities in children's life. All people know that the development of children is an extremely significant part of building a personality. To do so parents should try to involve their children in exploring local insects, animals or playing different games such as football, riding bicycles, and many other. This will only expand the knowledge of children, and consequently have a positive effect on their development. This is also important to have a healthy generation in the future. Parents can join their children or they can find some friends around and also be socially active. For example, a father can teach his son how to bicycle or how to take care of plants and trees.
The next important reason for doing more outdoor activities for children is avoiding physical problems, which can cause computer games. Currently, a lot of people including children suffer from different side effects of a lazy lifestyle and obesity can exemplify it. To avoid problems with physical health in the future, spending a couple of hours should be recommended to all children.
Of course, little time spent playing computer games will not hurt children, but it is important to limit it. To sum up, children should do more outdoor activities and play computer games less.",,,,,,8.5,"Some people argue that outdoor activities offer greater advantages for children's growth than computer games, and I mostly agree with this viewpoint. Firstly, spending time outside allows children to interact with their environment, which stimulates their curiosity and creativity. For instance, by playing games like tag or climbing trees, children not only exercise their muscles but also learn how to communicate and cooperate with their peers. This kind of physical activity helps to strengthen their bodies and build good habits for a healthy life in the future. In addition, being in nature can reduce stress and improve children's mental well-being, while supporting the development of skills such as problem-solving and adaptability. On the other hand, computer games, if played moderately, can have some positive effects, such as improving hand-eye coordination and teaching strategic thinking. However, too much screen time may cause health problems like poor eyesight, lack of concentration, and social isolation. While both activities have their own benefits, I believe outdoor experiences are generally more valuable because they contribute to physical health, social skills, and a balanced lifestyle. In conclusion, for a child's well-rounded development, I think outdoor activities should come before computer games while still allowing some time for technology use."
767,2,"Society is based on rules and laws. If individuals were free to do whatever they want to do, it could not function. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?","Rules and laws are important for society to functioning well in right path, if people do whatever they want freely in regular life then it might lead society to malfunction. This essay will argue why I completely reckon that laws are entirely needed for uplifting of civilisation.
There are plethora of reasons why rules and laws have implication of lifestyles. First and foremost reason is that, crime, accidents and environment. If there are not certain rules about crime then people definitely do many criminal activities in each and every place , so other persons do not fell secure and safe. If people have freedom for whatever they want to do then , it will very dangerous for society as well as environment. Secondly, young generation could not differentiate what is right or wrong without the teaching of rules. For example, if official authorities could freely get implicated in money laundering from the national budgets and not encounter any punishment , then possible results in the political, economic and social turmoil in the country.
Moreover, if there are no traffic rules then the situation of roads will not be imagined by anyone. The drugs are legal in countries then it is mainly effect on young generation's future and they will never know about right things. Pollution is only controlled by the Government's rules. If there are no any rules then human can not imagine the pollution level in the air.
On the contrary, some people think that, rules and laws are unnecessary for their rights. If people aware about, what is good or bad for society, environment and themselves then it is not issue about laws and rules. However, many persons really can not understand about rules , so the Government made for people's peace and safety. Regulation is key that perfectly handle people's life in particular manner.
To put in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, rules and laws are essential for the functioning of society. If citizens are given freedom to do whatever they like, then they will not only fall into bad habits but also creat confusion and nuisance in society as well as nation.",,,,,,5.5,"In my view, I firmly agree that society cannot work properly if people are allowed to do anything they want without any rules or laws. This is because rules help to keep people safe and stop fighting or dangerous behaviours. For example, strict laws against stealing and violence make most citizens feel comfortable to travel and go about their normal lives, since they know there are consequences for bad actions. Also, traffic laws are very necessary because without them, there would be more accidents and chaos on the roads. Rules also help to make the environment cleaner and fair by punishing those who pollute or cheat in businesses. While a few people believe that rules take away freedom, I think some rules are needed so that everyone’s rights are protected and society can grow in an orderly way. Therefore, I believe that laws are essential for the happiness and safety of all members of the community."
769,2,"Society is based on rules and laws. If individuals were free to do whatever they want to do, it could not function. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?","To be a part of a modern society people must follow laws that are set in place by the superior authorities. Some agree that if there would be no rules, our society could not function the way it does now. This essay will argue why rules and laws are necessary for a functioning society.
Some people have such high moral standarts, that even if there would be no rules, they would act exactly as they are with rules set in place. These people are geniunely kind and would never want to cheat ir cause harm to another person. It is not the law that makes them act this way, but rather their personality and values. This is why if everyone would be like this, no laws would be necessary, because people would act humane and want only the best for eachother.
The society we live in could not exist without rules and laws set in place to control it. Everyone is different and they have a different value system and understanding of what is an acceptable action and what is not. Some people believe that it is ok to steal from another, cheat or do harm to another person. Only thing that tries to keep them in place is our system law enforcement, that promises consequences if the rules are broken. For many people this is enough to live by the rules. However, even with the laws set in place, some still break them for their own benifit. If people commit crime, knowing that they can be punished for it, how many more would do harm if there would be no consequences to their action? For these reasons our world could not run without it being regulated by the system of law.
To conclude, even though some people naturally follow rules, it is not enough for a functioning society, because many others would feel free to do what they want to. Ultimately, our society could not function as it does now, if there would be no laws and rules to follow, and the possibility of serious consequences if those are broken.",,,,,,7.5,"It is widely agreed that rules and laws form the backbone of any successful society. Without these structures set by those in power, there would be no clear guideline as to what is acceptable or unacceptable behavior among the population. While some individuals naturally have strong ethical values and can act responsibly without laws telling them what to do, this is unfortunately not true for everyone. For the most part, people have different beliefs, experiences, and levels of respect towards others, making it risky to rely solely on people’s good nature. Laws are set to create fairness and safety, ensuring everyone is treated equally and protected from those who might wish to harm others or put their own interests before the wellbeing of the community. If everyone were allowed to do whatever they wished without worrying about the consequences, society would become chaotic and unsafe for the majority. Even now, some people choose to break the rules, despite the threat of punishment, which proves that the existence of laws is at least a partial deterrent. Therefore, while there might be a small number of people who would behave kindly without rules, society as a whole needs laws to function properly and protect its citizens."
771,2,"Society is based on rules and laws. If individuals were free to do whatever they want to do, it could not function. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?","It is commonly held that society can operate perfectly by a set of rules. It means that providing total freedom to people undoubtedly results in chaos with the further possibility of total collapse. I strongly agree with this point of view as I am in the opinion that rules play a significant role in creating a stable society. In this essay, this idea will be discussed in detail.
Basically, a set of rules can be helpful to achieve productive results in such essential areas as medicine and construction. For example, it is necessary to develop common procedures of operations in surgery or traffic rules for public transport. Unless there are not standardized, it might cause a lot of deaths or at least injuries. Constructing also should be based on common processes because comfort and safe accommodation is a necessity for many people. Although there are people who consider rules and laws limiting and imposing, it can be argued that they are critical in the organization of humanity.
Laws are not obstacles on the way to people's freedom because they are established to regulate formal relationships when it is difficult to find a compromise informally. Moreover, they are vitally important when people face crime and violence. Without any system of justice solving crimes becomes more challenging. All criminal accidents tend to be out of control and spread around the world immediately. Shoplifting, robbery, and even disastrous wars can plunge our world into darkness. This way humanity might face total chaos where morals values and behavioral patterns are neglected. In this context, the word ‘society’ risks becoming totally meaningless, as its main definition is a 'group of people with common traditions and rules.'
From the arguments presented above, one may conclude that any society needs standards, laws, or even moral principles. They form a foundation for safety, a good level of medicine, and science that allows to create a strong society and manage any difficulties or threats that may disturb people’s well-being.",,,,,,7.0,"The foundation of any successful society is the existence of rules and laws that regulate people's actions. Without a clear structure, allowing everyone to act entirely on their own desires would inevitably lead to disorder and conflict. I fully agree with the idea that rules and laws are vital for societal functioning because they provide guidance and security. For instance, in daily life, traffic laws prevent accidents and keep our roads safe, while regulations regarding health and sanitation prevent the spread of diseases. These rules do more than limit freedom; they make our environment predictable and allow cooperation among community members. Some may argue that rules can restrict personal liberty, but true freedom exists only when everyone’s rights are protected through fair regulations. If laws and rules were removed, theft, violence, or even simple misunderstandings would become common, making life unpredictable and unsafe. The lack of order would disrupt education, work, and social relationships, making it impossible to achieve collective progress. Therefore, it is clear that laws and regulations do not just restrict, but actually support freedom and stability, making them absolutely essential for a functioning, fair, and prosperous society."
773,2,"Some people say that modern technology has made shopping today easier, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion","The developing technology utilities and connections are thoroughly providing a massive benifit to people worldwide. Access to global markets has become a one click away. Many poeple are enthusiastic with such innovation, while others are not as much interested. This essay will essentially provide a discuss of the topic, followed by a final opinion supporting the discussion.
Purchasing items on the web is a tending thing to put into consideration. The huge tendency to get whatever basically required from a click of a finger is blessing for many. Such facility had enabled disabled people to get access to millions of global shopping markets with their varieties. In addition, it had proven its efficiency among the massive liquidity and momentum from overseas markets and local marketing agencies, in addition to the enormous numbers of online purchasers. For instance, getting a basic need from a grocery had become much more simple than getting to step out to the next building store. The absolute advantageous effect of this trend feature will benifit this generation, and the next, which will seem unprecedented.
On the other hand, despite the fact that the pros firmly outweighs the cons; they could sound quite frankly heavy to tolerate. Many dark facts of such virtual store system must be clarified. One fact is the delivery system. Late delivery could cause catastrophic consequences. Poor shipping as well is a jeopardizing negative issue. For example, One month ago, I have personally ordered from a famous well-known store in my region. The usual shipping time was stated to be form 3 - 5 days at most. With all respect. They never respected their delivery date expected, urging me to wait a period of 30 days with no exaggeration. However, other customers could have complained to the court and asked for their right, but i was much more tolerant and patient.
A good summary suggest, that how much was this online trading circle wide , popular and efficient. There must be some dark facts and troubles that in fact, could be solved. Ultimately, I suggest that this innovation will contain the global markets dramatically, getting a long ride to a store a forgettable thing.",,,,,,6.0,"Modern technology has significantly impacted the way people shop, and opinions on this change are quite divided. On the one hand, many people believe that advancements like online stores and mobile payment options have made shopping much easier than before. The ability to browse products and compare prices from anywhere in the world at any time is seen as a considerable advantage for busy individuals, elderly people, or those living far from stores. The variety and convenience available through technology mean that shoppers no longer need to physically visit multiple stores to make the best choice. On the other hand, a certain group argues that this technological shift has brought its own set of problems. They mention issues like receiving incorrect or damaged goods, difficulty returning items, and the lack of social interaction that used to come with shopping trips. Some also worry about the potential for increased impulse buying and the risk of online scams. Despite these challenges, I personally think that the pros of modern shopping technology strongly outweigh the cons. With proper caution, people can avoid most risks, and the added comfort and efficiency are features that benefit modern society in many ways."
775,2,"Some people say that modern technology has made shopping today easier, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion","One of the main objectives of technology is to facilitate people's lives. Nowadays, modern technology has been created to help people in several aspects of their daily lives, one of them being shopping. Some people consider that modern technology has made shopping easier, whereas, some detractors consider that these new technological gadgets have made it more difficult. I highly agree that the current technology has facilitate shopping due to the reasons explained in the following paragraphs.
On the one hand, technology has made shopping easier, because it saves people's money and time. Regarding shopping, new websites, such as, Amazon and Whish, as well as, applications, like Cornershop and Uber Eats, have enabled people to buy food, clothes and various goods from the confort of their homes. Thus, it is no longer necessary to travel to a shop, waste time in a queue and spend money in a parking ticket. This means that people can use the time that was spend in shopping on other activities (i.e., reading a book, doing sports, cooking, among others).
Moreover, technology enabled a new and varied competition in the market, making it possible that small shops, which were uknown and did not have the resources to have a physical space, now can be famous known. For instance, ""Mercado Libre"" (Free Market in English) is a website that helped several sellers make their products known to the public.
One the other hand, some detractors may indicate that technology has made shopping today more difficult, due to the lack of interpersonal relationship between the seller and the buyer. This hindrance makes it impossible to test the product before buying it. Nowadays, several people prefer staying at home and buy what they need in the internet or in an application, not being possible to have a face to face conversation with the person that it is selling a product. However, websites and applications have reviews by the consumers of the products, therefore, people can be informed of a good before it is bought.
In conclusion, modern technology may imply some complications like the lack of testing a product before buying it, however, the advantages are superior, mainly, because it has make people's lives easier, saving them time and money that could be used in other activities more enriching than going shopping.",,,,,,7.5,"Technology has changed the way people shop in many ways, and there are different opinions about whether this change is for the better. Some people argue that technology, such as online stores and shopping apps, has made buying goods much easier and more efficient. For example, people can now order groceries, clothes, and even electronics from their smartphones without leaving the house. This is especially useful for those who have busy schedules or live in places far from shopping centers. In addition, technology allows customers to compare prices very quickly, read reviews, and find the best deals, which can save both time and money. On the other hand, there are those who believe that shopping with technology has some drawbacks. One of the main reasons is that online shopping lacks the personal touch of speaking to a salesperson or seeing the product in person before buying it. Sometimes, people receive items that look different from what they expected, and returning products can be a hassle. Moreover, there are worries about privacy and security when sharing personal information over the Internet. Despite these negatives, I believe that the benefits of easier, faster, and often cheaper shopping made possible by modern technology outweigh the disadvantages. Overall, while there are challenges to address, technology has generally made shopping a more convenient experience for most people."
777,2,"Some people say that modern technology has made shopping today easier, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion","Nowdays the developping of modern technologies in the trade sphere provokes a lot of discussions. Some people notice significant simplification in shopping process because of these technologies whereas the other part of society denies this influence. As far as I am concerned, shopping has definitely become easier due to invention of new payment decisions.
On the one hand it is really difficult to ignore the creation of new payment decisions in the last decades likewise internet acquiring or different mobile technologies like Apple Pay, Google Pay etc. The two key features of all these innovations have become, firstly, decreasing the number of steps in the payment process and absence of visualisation of your own money as well since you pay by card or by phone, not by your cash. Because of these changes now the shopping is really easier for us regarding spending our money without any possibilities for extra thoughts.
At the same time some people can declare that due to modernisation and development of technologies a lot of companies and factories have started to create a huge variety of goods. As a consequence, customers usually struggle with choosing of what they actually need. At this point of view it is possible to regard the modernisation not as something to make the shopping easier but as the opposite of it. To clarify, the faster development is going on, the more confused an average customer is becoming because the harder for him to choose something and buy it.
As for my personal opinion, I concern the progress as something that usually helps me to buy goods. To elaborate, I have never had any issues with choosing in the shopping that is why it is difficult for me to express some empathy to the people who feel uncomfortable with it.
I can conclude thus that the question of technologies and their influence in simplification in shopping is debatable. There are some who spend their money easier then ever since the number of steps in the payment process has decreased, but there are customers who have issues and find the same process less comfortable. As for me, I am inclined to the first groop of people because I've also noticed a rised pace with that I've started to make my purchases.",,,,,,7.0,"Nowadays, the impact of modern technology on shopping habits is a subject of ongoing debate. Some people argue that new technologies, such as online shopping platforms and digital payment methods, have made shopping more convenient than ever before. For these individuals, the ability to shop from home and the variety of ways to pay, like using smartphones or contactless cards, has eliminated many traditional obstacles and saved them valuable time. On the other hand, there are those who believe technology has complicated the shopping experience rather than streamlined it. They point out that the overwhelming number of choices online or the constant updates to apps and devices can cause confusion, making it difficult to find exactly what one wants or to trust new systems. Personally, I believe that the advantages of technology far outweigh the disadvantages, as I have found shopping to be faster and easier overall; with a few simple clicks, I can order what I need and have it delivered directly to my house without waiting in long lines. In conclusion, while it is clear that both sides have reasonable points, I am convinced that modern technology, despite some challenges, has mostly simplified and improved the shopping experience for people today."
779,2,"Some people say that modern technology has made shopping today easier, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion","It is commonly argued that the fast pacing technology has helped people do shopping at the present time more easily. However, some people think online shopping is really difficult for them. This essay will consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the use of technology for shopping.
One disadvantage of online shopping can be mentioned is that people cannot familiarize themselves with online applications for ordering essential goods and food. In fact, the elderly are not good at technology enough to go to virtual supermarkets. Besides, those who live in remote areas are not accessible easily to technology to buy online groceries.
Despite its disadvantage, online shopping has brought about advantages for those who are technology natives. Firstly, it can be time-saving. In fact, shoppers can order any things they need with some clicks on the items, payment method, and time of delivery. Especially in a lingering Covid-19, when social distancing measures have been effective in some places in Viet Nam, according to a survey, the number of online shoppers has been increasing day by day, and thus many applications have been into existence, developed, and thrived.
Another advantage of virtual shopping is that it can be life-saving to many people in a pandemic across nations. Going to supermarkets can be detrimental to buyers due to the spread of viruses and the higher risk of infection. For example, in order to buy bread for breakfast, people have to go out for it and thus may be exposed to infectious or incubated victims of Covid-19. Moreover, with preventive measures of Covid-19 containment, such as people not being allowed to go out for their essential goods, if they do not know how to make an online order, it is really difficult for them to survive during a pandemic.
In conclusion, the use of technology for virtual shopping is beneficial to our time-saving and life-saving matters, though it is not familiar to some people. In my opinion, thanks to its advantages, I will continue to go shopping online, though the world has gone through the Covid-19 pandemic successfully.",,,,,,7.0,"There is a debate on whether advancements in technology have made shopping more convenient for people today, with some individuals welcoming these changes while others find them challenging. On the one hand, shopping apps and websites allow anyone to browse countless products and order groceries, clothes, or electronics from home, which saves time and eliminates the need for travel. Many busy workers or parents appreciate being able to make purchases at any time of the day. However, not everyone agrees that online shopping is simple or suitable for them. For instance, elderly individuals might struggle with setting up accounts, remembering passwords, or navigating unfamiliar websites. There are also concerns about internet security, such as the risk of scams or stolen card information, which make some people prefer traditional in-person shopping. Despite these drawbacks, the use of technology in shopping is becoming more widespread, especially after the pandemic forced many people to rely on delivery services. In my view, while technology may pose difficulties for some, the benefits of convenience, time-saving, and variety make it a positive development, and I believe over time, more people will adapt and learn to take advantage of these new ways to shop."

First of all, almost all people in our world have a connection to the internet where you can find whatever you want, starting from analyzing crucial information, ending with buying products online.

785,2,"In some countries, only few young people go to classical music concerts or or play classical music. Why? Should young people be encouraged to attend and learn more?","Classical music is one of the oldest artistic samples of our history. However, the young people of the new generations do not appreciate this kind of music. I believe that governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and I will support my stand with valid arguments in the following paragraphs.
First of all, the main reason behind the little interest of young people in classical music is the impact of globalization in music and arts. That is because people have the opportunity to know more about multiple things without leaving their homes. However, all this knowledge is only superficial and arts, more specifically classical music, is diminished by the big international industry of music. For instance, reggaeton music, despite the fact that its lyrics are often misogynous, is the most popular style of music these days.
Another reason is that children and young people have less interest in cultural matters than in the past because governments do not invest in culture and arts. In most countries, investment in culture has been drastically reduced and young people have no access to classical music concerts and much less a musical instrument that has a huge cost. Consequently, governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and the arts.
To summarise, this essay has examined the idea of classical music and why young people do not have an interest in this kind of music. As far as I am concerned governments should take responsibility in this matter and invest more money in culture and classical music encouraging young people to learn more about this kind of art.",,,,,,7.0,"In recent years, there are fewer and fewer young people attending classical music concerts or learning to play classical music in many countries. There are several possible reasons for this trend. Firstly, popular music genres like pop, rock, and hip-hop dominate the media and social networks, making it difficult for classical music to attract the attention of the younger generation. Additionally, many young people perceive classical music as old-fashioned or only for older people, which creates a barrier for them to appreciate or participate in it. Moreover, schools and local governments often cut funding for music education, so children do not have opportunities to learn classical instruments or attend concerts. I strongly believe that young people should definitely be encouraged to engage with classical music because it offers significant educational and emotional benefits. Learning about classical music can improve concentration, discipline, and creativity. Therefore, it is the responsibility of communities and governments to make classical music more accessible, perhaps by organizing free concerts or including classical music in school programs, so young people can better appreciate this important part of cultural heritage."
787,2,"In some countries, only few young people go to classical music concerts or or play classical music. Why? Should young people be encouraged to attend and learn more?","Why Classical Music has not garnered the attention and recognition it deserves?.In this article we will cover all factors that have led to this question and will also provide my views on this highly debated topic.
Classical music which is considered one of the oldest forms of music. It has been a part of history.If we look at the early 1800's or at early 1900's it was always classical music that garnered most attention and had people coming into concert halls to listen to musicians.It was an integral part of music in all countries.But with the evolution of music and introduction of more genres of music like Rock,Pop and Rap we have seen the rise in music which people found more appealing and intresting.
This has led to classical music being viewed as boring and stagnant, this can be viewed as the primary cause in fall of the popularity of classical music.
For example, going to a rock and roll concert which gets people involved and also allows them an opportunity to partake in the concert, which as you could understand would appeal more to the youth as compared to a classical concert where people would just view and appreciate with minimum involvement.
Classical music is also a skilled art that needs to be learned and honed but does not integrate any modern art. For example, Michael Jackson integrated dancing with his singing which widely appealed to the masses and encouraged youth into his concerts. So if you could see a similar integration with classical music concerts it could attract more youth towards classcial music.
Howerver, with this discussion we cannot forget that as various genres of music have been derived from classical music and youth learning classical music with attending more classical concerts would help them achieve their future music endevors and also give them a good understanding of music.
In conclusion, we can say that young people should be encouraged to go to classical music concerts as it would help them understand and appreciate music in its true form.However, attracting young towards classical music will need a evolution in classical music concert structure and integrate some components from other forms which would make it blend better with present day outlook.",,,,,,7.5,"In today's modern society, it is clear that fewer young people attend classical music concerts or choose to learn to play classical music, especially in some countries where modern music genres dominate popular culture. The main reason for this trend is the widespread popularity of contemporary music styles such as pop, hip hop, and electronic dance music, which are often seen as more relatable and entertaining by the younger generation. Modern music is easily accessible on social media and streaming platforms, allowing young people to instantly connect with the latest songs and trends. In contrast, classical music is sometimes perceived as old-fashioned, formal, or even irrelevant to their everyday experiences. Furthermore, classical music concerts may lack the energetic atmosphere or interactive elements that are common in today's music events, making them less attractive to young audiences. Despite this decline in interest, I believe that young people should still be encouraged to attend classical concerts and learn more about this genre. Classical music is an important part of our cultural history and has influenced the development of much of the music we love today. It can help young people develop discipline, patience, and a deeper appreciation for the complexity and beauty of music. Therefore, it would be beneficial to find new and creative ways to introduce classical music to the younger generation, perhaps by making concerts more engaging or incorporating modern elements, ensuring that this valuable art form continues to inspire future audiences."
789,2,"Many people now undertake extreme activities, from hang-gliding to mountain climbing.Why do people risk their lives in this way, and do you think this is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Extreme sports, such as mountain climbing and hand-gliding, have become increasingly popular over the past several decades. Now more than ever, athletes can be paid to do these activities full-time, encouraging more aspiring athletes to enter extreme sports. In addition, the addictive nature of these activities means that participants tend to stay in the sport for the thrill. While the increased popularity can result in more accidents, it can also make the sports safer as atheletes collectively learn from past mistakes.
While people have undertaken extreme activities long before the advent of television and social media, these new platforms give extreme sports the much needed sponsorship and attention. Nowadays, outlandish and dangerous acts can be televised and monetized, giving the athletes a way to make a living out of these events. Therefore, more people would feel encouraged to participate in these activities knowing that they can have a decent income. On top of the external motivation, most extreme athletes take part in these sports because they are thrilling and addicting. These atheletes chase the rush and validation that they get when doing dangerous activities. As a result, even without the external rewards, some people would still partake in these sports.
Given that people are motivated both internally and externally to participate in extreme sports, it is inevitable that these activities become more popular. While it is true that increased participation would result in more accidents, it would also create more lessons for future participants. In this way, these accidents and injuries would help educate future athletes on how to protect themselves. Moreoever, this increased popularity would also encourage governments to draft more safety regulations.
In conclusion, given that it is human nature to want to achieve feats of strength and courage, extreme sports would always be attractive for some. Because of this, there will always be people injuring themselves while pursuing these feats. Therefore, these activities would become safer the more athletes learn from past incidents.",,,,,,7.0,"In recent years, there has been a noticeable rise in people taking part in extreme activities such as skydiving, rock climbing, and base jumping. Many participants are motivated by a strong desire to test their personal limits and experience a sense of accomplishment that is hard to find in everyday life. Social media also plays a powerful role, as sharing spectacular videos or photos can lead to admiration and even sponsorship opportunities. For some, these challenges become an essential part of their identity and provide a break from routine, giving them an adrenaline rush that becomes almost addictive. Despite the inherent dangers, the growing interest can actually make these activities safer. As more people participate, there is greater incentive to improve equipment, establish safety protocols, and educate newcomers about risks. From my perspective, while it is understandable to worry about the risks, the trend towards extreme sports is not entirely negative. It encourages physical and mental fitness and even advances safety technology. However, it’s important that those involved take appropriate precautions and understand the dangers before participating. In summary, although there are risks, the popularization of extreme sports can bring about positive changes while instilling a sense of adventure and achievement in participants."

Humans in the world, in the present day do many paramount activities which are breathtaking, changing from hang-gliding to mountain climibing. In my opinion I think this is a good change for peoples lifes, under two considerable reasons, such as people get more life experiences in nature and for their physical fitness. In this essay I will ounline my opinion and provide reasons with valid examples.
On the one hand, human begins are under the pressure of globalisation, which leads them to get more trendy experiences from nature. Since younger generation is working towards the urban development of the world they are living in large cities full of pollution and high rising buildings. When ever they find enough spare time youngsters are trying to enjoy their lifes by climbing mountains which is hiking from the technical term. To contrast this gives them the opportunity to learn more about the outside world of cities, get more experience in mother nature. They develop their knowledge about the surroundings, such as the animals, birds and different flora and faunas. As an example one of my friends wanted to do the activity of flying which this is an human made activity, but after few findings through the internet and she seeing pictures how people enjoy hiking she decided to go on a trip to Mount Everest for climbing.
On the other hand, people, or the young generation have the sense that activity of flying apparatus are outdated and this is not providing then enough physical fitness to burn their calories. Due to these reasons some group of young as well as old people climb mountains to develop their well-being, mostly people such as athletes and humans who are having various diseases such as obesity, adore to do hiking.
To sum up, in my opinion this trend is not a bad idea for the poeple to get escaped from their busy lifestyles to enjoy the nature as well as develop their fitness rather than going to artificial equipment based buildings. In fact, every sport has their own risk, so people need to accept and beware of these risky issues and attend these activities.",,,,,,7.0,"In recent years, more and more individuals are drawn to taking part in risky activities like hang-gliding and mountain climbing. Personally, I believe the main reason people choose to risk their lives in such ways is to seek adventure and escape from their routine lives. The modern lifestyle can be very stressful and monotonous, especially for people who live in cities and work in offices all day. Engaging in these challenging activities helps them break free from their daily routine and discover new sides of themselves. Moreover, adrenaline rush can make people feel more alive, and knowing they achieved something difficult gives them a sense of accomplishment and boosts their confidence. Although there are dangers, I think this trend can be positive when done carefully and with the right precautions. It encourages people to be active and can help improve both physical fitness and mental strength. For instance, one of my classmates trained for months before attempting to climb a local mountain, and after completing the hike, she became more energetic and confident in school. In conclusion, while there are risks involved in extreme activities, I believe the benefits of gaining life experience, building confidence, and improving health outweigh the drawbacks, as long as people are well-prepared and responsible."

There are several reasons why people choose to take such risks. Firstly, many individuals feel a sense of adventure and excitement that cannot be found in everyday life, and these activities provide a thrill that helps them escape the monotony of their routine. Alongside this, taking part in extreme sports can boost confidence and improve mental strength, as overcoming fears in challenging situations brings a sense of accomplishment. For example, I know someone who recently climbed a high peak in the Himalayas, and he explained that the physical effort and danger involved made him feel more alive than ever. However, while this trend can offer physical and mental benefits, it is also important to recognize the dangers involved and the fact some people may push themselves too far. In my view, as long as participants are well-prepared, informed, and follow safety precautions, taking part in extreme activities can be a positive way to gain new experiences and improve personal well-being."
795,2,"Missions to explore space are hugely expensive, and there are problems on Earth which demand attention. The number of these missions needs to be reduced.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is supposed by many, that high-cost space studies should be cut off while more focus should be paid to the challenges mankind face on Earth. This essay completely disargees with such view because of two reasons that will de developed further.
The first reason is that only rich countries spend thier budgets for space studies. This means that only when states have resolved most of their problems with poverty, level of medicine treatment, safety, they can divert some of the funds to invest in future technologies. Moreover, citizens will go on a strike and make the govenment to deal with real life problems instead of dreaming about the space. For example, not more than 5% of USA GDP is spent on space programs that is sufficient to progress, construct new sputniks, and send astronauts to the Internations Space Station.
The second argument supposes that many space technologies have a dual puropose. In other words, being initially developed for studing the space, they were adopted to make people's day-to-day life easier. For example, mobile phones and the mobile Internet, navigaion using GPS would not be possibe if people were not trying to explore space.
In conclusion, new technologies are developed when people are trying to learn the world outside our planet. This",,,,,,5.5,"Some people believe that the cost of space exploration is too high and that we should instead use our resources to solve problems on Earth. However, I disagree with this opinion for a couple of important reasons. Firstly, space missions often lead to advances in technology that benefit everyday life. For instance, medical devices such as MRI scanners, water purification systems, and even improvements in weather forecasting were all influenced by research done for space exploration. Secondly, the budget allocated for space missions is actually quite small compared to the total spending on more urgent issues like healthcare, education, and poverty reduction. In many developed countries, governments ensure that the majority of public funds go toward solving immediate problems, while only a fraction is used for scientific discovery. To illustrate, NASA’s budget is less than half a percent of the United States’ total federal budget, yet the benefits from its research are significant. To sum up, though there are undoubtedly serious problems on our planet, reducing the number of space missions would not necessarily resolve them, and in fact might slow down progress in technology and science that could help address global challenges."
797,2,"The use of corporal punishment (physically hitting students) in schools is in decline, yet it should be used to improve behaviour.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","There is no doubt that these days student's punishment decreased in most schools. Some people believe that physical punishment is important to improve behaviour. While others totally disagree with that. In this essay, I am going to discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion.
In terms of people who agree with the student's punishment, they think that students need it to improve their attitude and to be good at school. To illustrate, when teachers physically punish students, Students will follow their instructions and avoid doing mistakes. In addition, other students will be carefule when they think to do any wrongs to avoid the punishment. So that will lead to seeing students who behave well and do no mistakes.
However, some people believe that using corpral as a physical punishment has negative effects on the students. Firstly, students who face physical ounishment from their schools will have many psychological issues like fear, low self confidence, and isolation. Secondly, theses students will hate going to school and continuing their education in the future due to this punishment. For example, students will think of school as a scary place instead of thinking of it as an education site. So it is very normal that they are going to avoid going there.
In conclusion, althogh some people agree with using corporal punishment, several people have their reasons to disagree with that. I believe that using corporal punishment or any kind of punishment with students at scool nowdays is unethical practice and should be avoided since there are a lot of ways to teach students to not do the wrong things.",,,,,,6.5,"It is true that corporal punishment has become less common in most schools these days, but some people still believe it should be brought back to help improve student behaviour. On one hand, supporters of physical discipline argue that it makes students listen more and helps maintain order in classrooms, as fearing punishment may stop students from acting out. For instance, they might say that if students know there are real consequences, they will take teachers seriously and show more respect. On the other hand, many people disagree and argue that hitting students does more harm than good. Being physically punished at school can make students afraid, upset, or even lose interest in learning. I have seen examples where students who were punished in this way struggled with low self-esteem and did not want to participate in class anymore. Furthermore, modern teaching methods encourage positive ways to guide students, such as rewards or talking to them about their behaviour. In my opinion, physical punishment is not the best way to improve behaviour because it causes more problems than it solves, and there are much better ways to help students learn discipline and respect."
799,2,"The use of corporal punishment (physically hitting students) in schools is in decline, yet it should be used to improve behaviour.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Despite the fact that physical punishment of pupils at schools is decreasing, it is considered by many that it improves discipline. This essay completely disagrees with this view because such measures are applied to those who are unable to counterattack and it maybe the easiest way but also the most inhumane.
Firstly, physical assault is usually applied by teachers against children who are not able to stop the violence. In other words, it is not highly probable that an adolescent will try to hurt a teenager who may stop the hitting or even push it back. Thus, kids are at higher risk because the only thing they are able to do in such cases is just try to run away. Moreover, children should understand that they earn what they deserve meaning that the level of repercussions should correspond to the seriousness of so called crime. For example, Sweden schools have publicly available the set of rules and non-physical measures that will be taken against the violators, that confirms that other methods are also effective to keep appropriate kids’ behaviour.
Secondly, it is much more easier for many to maintain a discipline using the fear of corporal punishment. This means that it seems unnecessary and time-waste for grown-ups to try to apply other methods while a hectic kid may be calmed down just in few seconds using the fear of pain. Pupils may not be involved in a lesson and interrupt a teacher because they are not interested in the subject that may be caused by the fact that the teacher was not able to select appropriate technics to convey knowledge. For example, a research conducted by a US institution revealed that 90% of corporal punishments were applied to pupils who did not l listened to their teachers during a lesson.
In conclusion, physical violence should be discontinued in schools because mostly weak kids are in danger and they are subject for such punishments because adolescents chose the simplest way of violence and fear to better the behaviour.",,,,,,6.5,"Although the practice of corporal punishment in schools is becoming less common, some argue that physically disciplining students is necessary for maintaining order; however, I completely disagree with this perspective. Firstly, using physical force to correct behavior teaches children to associate authority with violence, which can have long-lasting psychological effects. For example, studies from child development experts have shown that students who experience corporal punishment may develop anxiety, fear of adults, and trouble managing conflict without aggression. Furthermore, there are numerous alternative methods proven to be more effective at shaping good behavior, such as positive reinforcement, setting clear expectations, and using logical consequences. In countries where corporal punishment is banned, such as Finland, educators have found that students demonstrate higher levels of respect and are better able to regulate their actions because they feel supported rather than threatened. In addition, resorting to physical discipline often reflects a lack of patience or skill on the part of teachers rather than a true solution to behavioral problems. Therefore, I believe that the decline of corporal punishment is a positive trend, and that its elimination will create safer and more nurturing educational environments for all students."
801,2,"The use of corporal punishment (physically hitting students) in schools is in decline, yet it should be used to improve behaviour.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is the common knowledge that the corporal punishment was used in school during the previous generations. Although it has been declined, some argue that it should be used to exceel the conduct. I personally disagree with this notion because physical punishment compromise the mental and physical well-being of students.
It is well-established that in the modern times educational procedures have changed hugely compared with previous decades. For instance, psychologists were not part of the school staff before the modern times. Today pupils behaviour is analysed throughout systems and complex theories in order to understand their apptitudes before to produce judgements and punishments. When in the past students were drastically hitting by educators, it repercuted in negative consequences because physical and mental traumas resulted as a product of this practice. Some pupils developed violent behaviours and others suffered from lack of confidence and self-harmed, even some of them commited suicide.
Despite the negative evidence of corporal punishment on students, the education system implemented new methods and modalities to maintain the students bahaviour. First of all, the physical punishment was entire banned from schools, even, teachers might face legal meassures if they impart this kind of punishment. Secondly, psychologists play an important role in schools today because they are able to understand the social environment of students, thus, they know what mechanisms use to improve their behaviour. For instance, these professionals are capable to use a bunch of principles, values and speechs that are scientifically proved leaving the physical punishment behind in the history.
To conclude, corporal punishment was used in the past to control students behaviour, nowadays it has been drastically reduced Nonetheless some claim that it should be used again to improve conducts. I strongly disagree with this statement because it is proved that this practice caused negative impacts in students life, furthermore, new professions and methods are implemented which have demostrated high rates of efficacy to pursuade and improve the well-behaviour in students.",,,,,,6.0,"Corporal punishment was commonly used in schools to discipline students many years ago, but nowadays this practice is becoming rare and is even illegal in most countries. Some people still believe that physically punishing children can improve their behaviour, but I completely disagree with this idea for several reasons. First of all, research shows that corporal punishment can lead to long-term emotional problems, such as anxiety, fear, and low self-esteem among students. When a child is hit by a teacher, they might start to view school as a frightening place instead of a safe environment for learning, which could negatively impact their academic achievements. Furthermore, there are more effective and humane alternatives available to manage behaviour problems, like using counselling, positive reinforcement, or communicating directly with students and parents. For example, if a student behaves badly, a teacher can try to understand what caused the behaviour and discuss it with them, encouraging reflection and responsibility rather than resorting to violence. In addition, some students become rebellious or aggressive after being physically punished, as they may learn that violence is an acceptable response to problems. In conclusion, bringing corporal punishment back to schools is not a solution to behavioural issues, since it creates more harm than good and there are far better ways to guide students towards positive conduct."

I strongly disagree with this this view as I am of the opinion that there are better ways of disciplining children to instill positive behaviour, than physically hitting them.
Improvement of behaviour among children in schools can be achieved through teaching them good manners rather than using corporal punishment. This means that teachers and school staff should teach children acceptable and unacceptable behaviour as part of their school curriculum from the earleist age they enter school. This way, learners obtain knowledge required for them to practice good behaviour. For example, if a child is taught from primary school-going age that they should clean after their mess, they are likely to practise and carry this behaviour through to secondary school. That way, there would be no need to physically hit children. Although some may firmly believe that corporal punishment is a good form of discipline, it cannot be compared to the actual teaching of good behaviour.
Moreover, corporal punishment is likely to produce a fearful and resentful child rather than a well mannered child. It has been found by many researchers that children are unlikely to change their bad behaviour because they are beaten up at school. The behaviour is most likely to get worse, instead, as learners become fearful and resent their learning environment. For instance, in South Africa, some learners were reported to be disrespectful to their teachers because of a bad relationship that existed between them and their teachers as a result of corporal punishment that was inflicted on them. While it may be true that some positive behaviour changes were seen among pupils due to use of corporal punishment, this is at a very small scale.
In conclusion, I am of the view that the use of corporal punishment among school-going age children is not a desirable phenomenon, as it is unlikely to produce any required behavioural changes.

Positive discipline methods, such as rewarding students for their good actions and clearly explaining what is expected of them, are much more likely to produce respectful, responsible students. For example, when I was in school, our teachers would often hold discussions with us about class rules and reward us with praise or small prizes when we followed them, which made us more motivated to behave well. In contrast, students who are often punished physically may become angry or afraid and are less likely to respect their teachers, resulting in a negative school environment. Although there may be some people who feel that corporal punishment is needed to keep order in the classroom, I believe that it is outdated and unnecessary when there are so many better ways to teach children how to behave appropriately."

Personally, I strongly disagree with the idea that hitting students is an effective way to encourage good behaviour. Firstly, corporal punishment teaches children to associate learning with pain and fear, rather than understanding and respect. Positive behavioural change is more likely to result from clear guidelines, consistent expectations, and positive reinforcement. For example, when teachers reward good behaviour or give constructive feedback, students are more motivated to behave correctly and feel respected in the process. Additionally, corporal punishment can harm the relationship between students and teachers, leading to a lack of trust and open communication. Research has shown that children who are regularly subjected to physical punishment may develop anxiety, depression, or aggressive tendencies, which can impact their overall development and future success. Finally, alternative methods such as conflict resolution programs, counselling, or restorative justice circles have been proven to address behavioural issues more effectively by helping students understand the impact of their actions and encouraging empathy. In conclusion, while some people still believe that physical discipline is necessary to maintain order, I believe that it is an outdated practice with potentially harmful consequences, and that schools should focus instead on teaching and modelling good behaviour in positive and supportive ways."

In the last century there is an opposite trend, which leads to bans on any physical punishment. I believe any corporal punishment should be against the law in schools and any other facilities.
Recent studies show, that violence is neither most effective nor useful method in education. According to the scientists, any type of physical punishment creates a negative psycological pattern. Students focus on fear and put extra effort into learning things by hard. But students don't use this knowledge or keep it after upcomming test or exam.
Besides, these methods harm students and reduce creativity in the future. Scientists say, that physically abused kids develop psycological disorders in the future life. This leads to an increased suicide rate, higher chance of depression, and lower happiness.
Most importantly, physical punishment doesn't address the core of the problem. There are several reasons for a low school performance: a low interest in the topic, a bad explanation, or a low quality of life. To increase students performance we have to focus on quality of education first. But there are some good news. Humanity made a huge progress since internet and youtube are much more accessable nowdays.
In general, there is not a single piece of evidence which support physical punishment. It's a method from the past that should not be used nowdays. Corporal punishment leads to lower performance, psycological disorders, and doesn't solve any real problem.

However, modern views have shifted away from this practice, and I strongly disagree that it should be used to improve student behaviour today. Many psychological studies demonstrate that hitting students often causes more harm than good, leading to fear, anxiety, and resentment toward both teachers and school in general. For example, children who experience corporal punishment tend to feel humiliated and their self-confidence can suffer, which makes learning harder in the long run. Additionally, the threat of physical punishment may stop misbehavior temporarily, but it does not teach students why their actions were wrong or encourage them to make better choices in the future. In my own school experience, I noticed that teachers who managed their classrooms through respect and communication had much better results than those who raised their voices or used any form of force. Positive discipline, encouragement, and clear expectations are proven to foster a healthier and more effective learning environment. In conclusion, corporal punishment is outdated and damaging, and there are better approaches available to help students learn and behave well in schools."
809,2,"The Internet is now used all around the world as a source of information and communication. However, it's often controversial, so many people think it needs to be controlled. Others believe there should be no interference whatsoever.Discuss both points of view, and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","The Internet has recently become the most widely spread means of communication and knowledge sharing. It is argued by many if any restrictions should be imposed on it. This essay will discuss both views and explain why the Internet should be free from regulations.
One group of people consider that the Internet was developed to overcome a government censure, thus any restrictions will destroy its purpose. Despite the fact that there were independent media, it was practically difficult to share news internally and internationally because of low speed of communication methods such as telegraph or post, which lead to the fact that the most common source of information was government authorities who selected the information they wanted to share. Thus, general citizens’ opinion, views and problems were often unheard. This essay agrees that the ability of sharing information freely between people all over the world makes the government to be transparent as everyone’s opinion and problem may be heard. For example, the problems with extinction of wild animals in Baikal region of Russia due to forest cuts was heard only after a massive attack by the media and local citizens and bloggers that would be impossible without the Internet.
The others insist that the Internet allows to people share not only useful knowledge, problems and new, but also violent content. The supporters of the view believe that having an easy access to such content, for example assault, production of bombs, people become prompt to criminal behaviour. Although, the Internet makes the violent information more available, the essay suggests that if an individual want to find violent information, he would do it even in the absence of the Internet. Moreover, recent researches conducted by criminalists uncovered that the increase in the number of criminal offenses is not directly correlated with Internet coverage.
In conclusion, although the Internet contains violent content, if needed it may be accessed by interested people from other sources of informations, meanwhile independent flow of information allows individuals to attract attention to their local and even global problems which may be hidden by governments without free Internet.",,,,,,7.0,"The widespread use of the Internet has transformed how people acquire information and communicate globally, raising questions about whether it should be regulated. Some individuals argue that control is necessary, asserting that the Internet can spread harmful content such as hate speech, scams, or misinformation. They believe rules and monitoring are essential to prevent negative impacts on society, especially when considering vulnerable groups like children who might access inappropriate material. On the other hand, many support the view that restrictions threaten the fundamental purpose of the Internet—to enable free expression and the open exchange of ideas. These people worry that excessive regulation might lead to censorship, stifling voices that are important for social progress and governmental accountability. For instance, protests and movements around the world have gained momentum precisely because the Internet allowed people to share uncensored stories and organize collectively. In my opinion, while some limited guidelines are reasonable to protect against severe harm, the overall freedom of the Internet must be preserved to maintain its positive influence on society. When it comes to striking a balance, transparency and public oversight in any control mechanisms are essential, so that the Internet remains a space for collaboration and innovation rather than oppression."

However, it is being frecuently controversial, because whereas some claim to control it, others request its entire freedom. In my opinion, Internet needs to be controlled and in some instances it needs to be restricted.
Internet is a useful modern technology that has changed the methods of communication and the information storage. However, it is vital to establish regulations in its use, because, even though, it is a great technological advance that improved the communication and information procedures. it is also a powerful mechanism that might impact negatively the human lives. For instance, internet can be use to obtain personal information that could be use in unlawful ways such as supplant identities to commit virtual crimes. Therefore, if internet is not use within legal frames, the probabilities of intranet crimes are likely to increase in the entire society.
On the other hand, some people claim for its freedom because they do not want to be surveillanced. Althouth some people claim for freedom of their privacy, it looks like they do not understand the importance of a set of rules within the internet to protect privacy. For instance, some couples like to share nude images and videos between themselves through social media apps. however, there is evidence that these kind of content have been stolen to blackmail the couples in return for not revealing their compromising information. Therefore, if people claim for freedom when navigating into the red, it is crucial to have legal parameteres that might help to protect their privacy.

For example, fake news shared online can quickly mislead large groups of people, sometimes causing real harm in society. On the other hand, some individuals believe that any interference would threaten freedom of speech and privacy, arguing that open access is crucial for democracy and innovation. They point out that excessive control could be misused by authorities to silence dissenting opinions or limit access to important resources. In my opinion, while it is important to protect freedoms on the internet, there must also be reasonable regulations in place to prevent abuse and protect vulnerable users—such as children—from harm. Balanced laws and thoughtful monitoring can help ensure the internet remains both a safe and open space for everyone."

Some people hold that the use of internet should fall under control, while others disagree and argue that such control is groundless. This essay will analyse both positions and illuminate my standpoint.
As for those who support the control of the internet use, they may have their position grounded upon the fact that criminal activities run rampant online, threatening individual and public security, as exemplified by hacking technology aimed at stealing personal data illegally, fraudulent advertisements aimed at cheating money and notices post by terrorist groups brainwashing the public. Such activities, if unchecked, may exert undesirable effects on individuals and society. Given such omnipresent dangers online, the control of online activities may be justified.
On the contrary, in terms of those objecting to the control of the internet use, they may justify their position by highlighting importance of unlimited online activities, as demonstrated by the improvement of work efficiency. A case in point is that posting advertisements online is apparently more efficient than issuing leaflets on a street, from the perspective of a company intending to publicising its services and products. However, the notices post online may present fake information cheating the public. To address this issue, it is necessary to control online activities.
As far as I am concerned, in view of omnipresent hazards online, intervention is needed to screen dangerous information and ensure the safety of the internet use.
To conclude, the control of online activities helps to protect us from various cybercrimes, although it may slightly affect the efficiency of work. Personally, I opine that the importance of online control should not be underestimated.",,,,,,8.5,"With the prevalence of the Internet globally, it has become indispensable for acquiring information and engaging in communication, though this widespread use has stirred much controversy. Advocates for stronger Internet control argue such measures are critical due to the proliferation of harmful content, including cyberbullying, identity theft, and the spread of false information, which can lead to damaging real-world consequences. For instance, the rapid distribution of misinformation during health crises has sometimes resulted in public confusion or even panic. On the other hand, opponents claim that imposing controls infringes on freedom of expression, which is fundamental in democratic societies, and can hinder the flow of useful information necessary for innovation, social interaction, and business. For example, social media platforms allow users to connect globally and access knowledge rapidly, which might be restricted under strict controls. From my perspective, while total freedom online can lead to misuse, some level of regulation is justified in order to shield users from overt dangers without unnecessarily stifling beneficial communication or learning. In conclusion, although strict Internet control may impact the free exchange of ideas, a balanced approach with reasonable regulations is essential to protect users and preserve the primary benefits of the Internet."

Some people hold that such control is necessary, while others disagree and argue that the use of internet should not be restricted. This essay will analyse both positions and illuminate my standpoint.
As for those agreeing with the control of online activities, they have their position grounded upon the fact that numerous criminal activities run rampant online and should be tackled effectively, as exemplified by fraudulent advertisements aimed at cheating money and hacking technologies targeted at violating privacy. If unchecked, cybercrimes would increasingly disturb the society and cause widespread complaints. Another reason reinforcing this position is that the online information that is inappropriate for minors should be reduced, such as the movies containing erotic or violent scenes, as well as foul language. Otherwise, children may be led astray by such information, acting improperly at home or school.
In terms of those who barely support online control, they may justify their position by explaining the importance of unlimited internet access to task efficiency. For instance, businessmen could seek potential clients by online searching, which is apparently more efficient than issuing leaflets on a street publicizing themselves. However, if internet users cannot identify the authenticity of online information, they may assume the risk of being cheated. Given this concern, a certain extent of intervention is needed for screening fake information.
As far as I am concerned, I opine that online control is justified, because it helps to address multiple cybercrimes and inappropriate information for adolescents. I expect in the future, more views could arise to furnish the understanding in this regard.",,,,,,8.0,"The internet plays a vital role in modern society as a source of information and a means of connecting people around the globe. While some argue that access to such a powerful tool should be monitored, others insist that any control threatens freedom of expression. Those who advocate for regulation often point to the proliferation of harmful activities online, such as cyberbullying and identity theft. These dangers can have devastating consequences, particularly for vulnerable groups such as young people, so oversight is seen as a way to protect users. Furthermore, there is concern about the spread of false or misleading information, which can harm individuals and disrupt societies. On the other hand, opponents of internet regulation argue that restrictions could lead to censorship or limit access to knowledge. They believe that everyone should have the right to share information and exchange ideas freely, as this promotes progress and creativity. From my perspective, limited control is necessary to create a safer online environment, particularly in preventing illegal activity and shielding minors from inappropriate content. However, such controls should be carefully managed to avoid stifling open discussion or hindering innovation. Ultimately, a balanced approach that safeguards users while respecting freedom of speech best serves the interests of society."

It has dramatically changed how we communicate with each other and how we obtain news. With only one push of button on our devices like a smart phone or a laptop we can speak our family members who are thousand miles away from us or read current news without a need for watching TV or buying a newspaper. However, this convenience of the Internet carries some potential threats to the users such as violation of their privacy rights and overflow of unreliable information. Therefore, the users should demand some forms of regulations of the Internet to reduce these risks.
Certainly, the use of the Internet needs to be regulated if we want to preserve our privacy when using it. Unfortunately, there is an enormous flow of our personal data on the Internet. For example, we eagerly share a lot of information about ourselves simply from our name, address, phone number to more serious one like our accounts number or social security. However, the big sales companies very often buy an access to this data to target us and influence our choices. This practice should be illegal and we as the users need to have a say how our personal data should be handled on the Internet. For this reason, we need to demand privacy laws to have better control how our personal information is managed on the Internet.
Another risk of having the Internet free from regulation is that we have no means of protection from unreliable information. I find this risk very dangerous since many people have used the Internet as their primary source of news and rely on it to stay updated with daily news. Now, anybody can become a reporter as long as he or she has access to the Internet. Simply, people can write and post their comments that often don’t have any factual or scientific base. We have witnessed this misinformation during the debate regarding vaccinations for the COVID-19. Many people who objected to be vaccinated made up their mind reading some posts on the Facebook or the Twitter that stated harmfulness of vaccines. These posts are allowed to be posted, because the social media don’t have any obligation to check the content of posts. Clearly, this wouldn’t happen if there were some forms of regulations that can verify better factual content of information on the Internet, so the potential readers can avoid the risk of misinformation.

On the other hand, however, there are clear dangers associated with a completely unregulated Internet. Without any controls, false information, cyberbullying, and even illegal activities such as hacking and scams can spread easily. For instance, during the pandemic, I noticed that much misinformation about health spread quickly online, causing confusion and sometimes even harm. In my opinion, some regulation is necessary to protect users from these dangers, but it should be balanced in such a way that basic freedoms are not threatened. Governments and technology companies could work together to tackle harmful content and protect user privacy without restricting everyone’s access to useful or important information. In conclusion, while total control of the Internet is not desirable, a thoughtful, balanced approach to regulation is needed to keep people safe and well-informed in the digital age."

Conversely, it always stirs controversy as a lot of individuals opine that it needs to be regulated while others think that there should be no form of interference.This essay will elucidate both point of views and i will give my opinion.
Since the advent of internet, life has been a whole lot better than it used to be.People can now get information at the confort of their beds or even while on transit. For example, people can be on the train and will still be able to know the latest news because modern trains now have tvs in them which travellers can use for their relaxation. In addition, internet has made communication incredibly easier and faster.To illustrate, a recent survey showed that over a billion people worldwide make use of Facebook,a social media app in which we can chat with friends and family.It has the feature of both communicating by voice call or video call.
However, there are some demerits of the internet. To start with, it is slowly killing the culture of meeting up with friends and family physically. Due to the fact that you can easily text or call them on phone , majority of individuals now rarely spend time with their friends and loved ones. This will apparently have a negative effect on the bonds of the relatoinships. Secondly, the internet can serve as a tool to spread false informations that can tarnish one's reputation. Take for instance, the senate president of Nigeria was falsely accused of a scandalous affair with an actress. This malicious accusation not only destroyed his home but also costed him his job.
The internet is now a popular means of communication and information. However, it should be regulated.

Therefore, the total population in the country seems to be not changed, but the balance of the population has been widening in a few decades. I would like to share some example in Japan and suggest ideas to reverse its population in the countryside.
Mainly, job opportunities in the big cities are much higher than in the countryside. The majority of companies and foreign company branches tend to be located in Tokyo, and Osaka. Therefore, people need to move to the big cities or suburbs area to get their jobs. This means that real estate, house, and apartment prices have been soaring drastically. Moreover, the phenomenon connects to the prices rise up in a variety of industries. For example, the food prices in the restaurants need to raise due to monthly tenants payment has been surging. Therefore, people can easily get or change their job in big cities, it is not necessarily wealthy.
Nevertheless, ironically, since Covid-19 widely spread worldwide, many companies launched remote work. Even now, the majority of people do not need to commute to the office. In addition, some companies declare that they never change the working system in the future, because they have already systemized the IT system which is able to work remotely. Therefore, this is a great chance for the Japanese government to dissipate the population in local cities. If people start to move to local cities or countryside, the population in the local cities or countryside increased. It will be not only helpful for people to live there with reasonable prices, but also for effective economic growth in the local cities and countryside. In addition, the local governments will be able to organize the infrastructure, roads, medical care, and education. As a result, the quality of the infrastructure will be close to the big cities.
Finally, if the government financially supported this remote working system to companies, the above phenomenon will be available. As a result, the disparity of wealth will not be wider, and people will be able to get job opportunities with living in the countryside.",,,,,,5.5,"The migration of people from rural areas to cities is a common trend in many countries, leading to various urban problems such as overcrowding, increased living costs, and pressure on public services. One major cause of this movement is the lack of employment opportunities in the countryside, where most jobs are related to farming and offer lower salaries compared to positions available in urban centers. Furthermore, cities tend to provide better education, healthcare, and entertainment options, which attract young people who are looking for a modern lifestyle. Another important factor is the centralization of industry and technology in metropolitan areas, making it difficult for rural residents to find similar opportunities at home. However, this situation can be reversed through several measures. For example, the government could invest in rural infrastructure, such as roads, internet access, and schools, making these areas more attractive to families and businesses. Additionally, encouraging companies to set up branch offices outside big cities and supporting remote work could allow people to live in the countryside while maintaining good jobs. In my own country, some small towns have experienced growth because local authorities promoted tourism and small enterprises, which created jobs and improved quality of life. By taking such actions, the balance between rural and urban populations could be restored, and many urban problems might be eased."

It occurs in many parts of the world, causing problems, especially in urban areas. This essay will elaborate on the causes of this movement, and the way it can be reversed from my personal standpoint.
Centralization has caused this movement. All the major institutions and facilities are in the cities. Thus, people in rural areas have to sacrifice considerable time and effort to travel to urban centres. As it is also costly, people choose to move into the cities so that traveling does not consume their time. For instance, one-fifth of the total population in Korea currently lives in Seoul, the capital city of Korea. In fact, all the educational, medical, and entertainment facilities are centralized in urban areas. It can be reserved by implementing decentralization. The government has to disperse the location of the major institutions and diverse types of facilities into different districts so that people living in remote areas can also benefit.
Furthermore, people in remote areas want to earn opportunities for better employment or education. As a city is a point where technologies, investments ,and professions gather, there is a better opportunity for people to get employed or educated in a improved quality. Therefore, people choose to leave the countryside. Thereby, the government can initiate the policies in which firms earn benefit when they move their head office to districts. If the firms commence moving, it will produce a great amount of employment.
Conclusively, not only the government but also the businesses and institutions have to co-operate to combat problems resulting from a surge in the movement of people from the countryside into the cities.",,,,,,7.0,"The migration of people from rural areas to cities is a common phenomenon all over the world, and it has created various issues, particularly in urban settings. The primary reason for this trend is the perception that cities provide a higher standard of living, better job prospects, and improved access to services such as hospitals, schools, and entertainment. Many people leave the countryside because agricultural work tends to be less stable and lower-paid, often depending on unpredictable factors like weather. For example, I have seen in my own country that young people abandon farming villages in search of office jobs in the city, hoping for a more comfortable lifestyle. However, this leads to overcrowding in cities, increased pollution, and a strain on public infrastructure. To address these challenges, governments could invest more in rural development, such as improving education, transport, and healthcare systems outside cities. Another solution would be to offer incentives for businesses to set up in smaller towns or rural regions, creating new jobs and opportunities there. By making rural life more appealing and providing similar advantages to those found in urban areas, it may be possible to slow down or even reverse the movement of people into cities."

In my opinion, some of the causes might be the transition from agricultural to technological economies and the lack of support from governments to coutryside economy. I will suggest that major support and promotion of the agricultural services might encourage people to stay at coutryside.
The national migration is a well-know fact that happen into the countries as a product of technological advancements and its impact in the national and international economy. The service sector is nowadays the main activity within the countries, which resulted in more opportunities along the the cities of the world because this sector is mainly located in cosmopolitan areas, therefore, rural people have decided to emigrate to the cities seeking to improve their standard of living. Additionally, with the growth of the service sector, governments have reduced the funding for countryside which resulted in high rates of unemployed people in that regions. This lack of support, encourage the movement of people as a negative side effects in the cities because of overcowded populations.
In order to mitigate the overcrowded populations accross the cities in the world, it is crucial to support and promote the country side economies to avoid the movement of people domestically. Governmments need to increase the budged allocated to rural areas, but additionally, they ought to provide better systems to promote and increase the participation of agricultural economies. If farmers find the adecuate support to produce the farms, they are less unlikely to abandond their lands because they already have a livelyhood. This support may impact benefically in cities because differents social issues could be reduced.
In conclusion, it is an undeniable fact that the domestic migration happens because of technological advancements and lack of support to countryside economy. Nonetheless, if some measures are incremented and adecuated to the countryside. I strongly believe that farmers are likely to work their lands instead of migrate.",,,,,,7.5,"The increasing movement of people from rural areas to cities is a widespread phenomenon that often leads to significant issues in urban centers, such as overcrowding, unemployment, and pressure on public services. The main cause of this trend is the lack of opportunities in the countryside, where modern technology and mechanization have reduced the need for manual labor in agriculture, leaving many people without work. Furthermore, rural areas often lack basic amenities like good schools, hospitals, and entertainment, encouraging especially young people to seek a better quality of life in cities. To reverse this trend, governments should focus on improving the infrastructure and economic opportunities in rural regions. For example, they can invest in rural education, healthcare, and transportation, and provide incentives for businesses to set up in smaller towns, which would create new jobs. Additionally, supporting small-scale farming and rural industries with grants or low-interest loans would help rural residents maintain their livelihoods. In my view, if rural communities become more prosperous and offer a higher standard of living, fewer people will feel compelled to move to cities, thereby reducing urban problems and balancing development across the country."

However, this rapid migration has led to popluation explosion in cities which seems to put tremendous pressure on available resources. In order to restore normalcy, this movement ought to be reversed and this can be done in a number of ways.
To begin with, the most common reason why people move to urban centers from rural areas is the fact that urban areas provide a wide range of opportunities that enable people to live a better life. For instance, all major metropolitan areas in the world provide access to state-of-the-art facilties in healthcare and education. Needless to say, both these aspects are the piilars of a good quality life that every individual desires to live. Unfortunately, as rural areas generally lag far behind in both these aspects, people are forced to migrate to cities. Moreover, urban dwellers are undoubtedly benefitted by advancements in all avenues of inquiry compared to their rural counterparts. This is because of the speed with which urban areas are able to incorporate these advancments into their infrastructure. While it may take a couple of months for a technological innovation to make its way to a village, it is not uncommon to see resdidents of a city making use of that innovation within no time. Thus, it makes perfect sense for people to leave the countryside in order to settle in cities.
However, cities are suffering from a host of problems because of large number of people opting to settle here. Firstly, accomodating a burgeoning population is a grave challenge that grips cities. This can be circumvented by providing villages with the basic facilties essential to support life. This would deter people from migrating to cities. Besides, if attempts are made to integrate rural areas into the mainstream, they would be benefitted by latest technological developments and people would no longer feel the need to move to cities in order to take advantage of those advancements.
To conclude, although there are many reasons why individuals are migrating from the countryside into the cities in many parts of the world, if development in rural areas is emphazised upon, this trend could be reversed.",,,,,,8.0,"The phenomenon of people relocating from rural regions to urban centers is increasingly prevalent worldwide, and this trend has resulted in significant issues, especially for cities. One of the main causes behind this migration is the lure of better job opportunities and higher wages in metropolitan areas. For example, young people often feel compelled to leave villages where agriculture is no longer profitable and move to cities in the hope of finding employment in industries or offices. Furthermore, cities offer access to improved social amenities, such as modern hospitals, educational institutions, and entertainment, which are often lacking in remote countryside areas. However, the swelling urban population leads to overcrowding, traffic jams, rising housing costs, and strain on infrastructure. In order to reverse this trend, governments and stakeholders could focus on investing in rural development. By improving the quality of education, healthcare, and transportation in villages, rural areas would become more attractive places to live and work. Additionally, incentivizing businesses to set up operations in smaller towns could provide job opportunities closer to home, which might dissuade people from moving to cities. In summary, while the shift from rural to urban living is driven by the pursuit of better opportunities, this movement can be counteracted by making life in the countryside more sustainable and appealing through targeted investment and policy."

I will write about my thought of the cause of the movement from the countryside into the cities, and if there is a possibility to reverse this event, what it will be.
First, I think the cause of the movement is partly because of the difference of the convenience, and the work types you can get between in the countrysides, and in the cities. Personally I do prefer to live in the countrysides, but I can't bare if there are none or slow internet connections there. Also I think the varieties of the jobs you can get are quite different in each location. For example, when I went to Australia to get jobs, of course people tend to stay in the cities so that they can get easy, fancy city jobs like waiter/waitress, shop retail, jobs related with news papers and so on. However the number of jobs are limited. I really wanted to stay in the city, but the amount of money you get was not quite enough to pay rent, and holiday fee, so I moved into the countrysides which had varieties of farm jobs. Sure there were easy jobs like in the cities, but the number of shops, and restaurants are quite small, and they were hiring mostly local people rather than working holiday workers. There I got a farm hand job in the tomato field. It was really hard job. We needed to work from 7 am when the sun rises to 6 pm when the sun sets. It was hard for my poor body, too. That is why I think most people move to the cities rather than stay in the countrysides.
Although I am not sure if there is a possibility to reverse this event, I think there are quite a lot of good experience you can only get in the countrysides. One thing I can say is the people and the living pace are slower, and more relaxed in countrysides than in the cities. For example like I myself said, I prefer living in the countrysides than in the cities. In fact I moved to Edmonton in Canada, which is a city, but I'd say more like a town, but a lot more relaxed than Tokyo where I used to live. Sometimes people living in the crazy fast cities like Tokyo, New York, and etc actually want to slow down the pace to more relaxing cities, or countrysides. If we want to reverse this movement, I think you need to advertise what benefits you can get in the countrysides. For example, they have quite magnificent views, good benefits to raise your kids, and so on. I think it can really reverse the movement because nowadays people are so interested in the educations of their kids, so scientifically we need to prove that living in the countrysides, and raising the children can be really beneficial for them. I myself have 2 children, and I can feel the benefits of living in the countrysides. The more free time they have, the more creative they become, and I strongly believe the more creative they are, the more happier they can lead their lives.
As a result, I believe that we can reverse, or slow down the speed of the movement of the people from the countrysides into the cities if we empharsise the benefits of raising kids in the countrysides more.",,,,,,7.5,"The movement of people from the countryside to the cities is a phenomenon seen in many countries, and I think it is caused mainly by the hope of finding better jobs and a more comfortable lifestyle.

However, this results in crowded cities with too much traffic, higher costs of living, and problems like pollution or lack of housing, while villages become emptier and older. To reverse this situation, I think governments and businesses could invest more in countryside areas by creating new types of jobs, such as in technology or tourism, and making sure there are good schools and health services. Personally, I have heard of some people moving back to the countryside to escape city stress and to work online, which is possible now with fast internet. If more people see the countryside as a place with a good quality of life and opportunities, then maybe the movement towards cities will slow down or even start to go the other way in the future."

I really wanted to stay in the city, but the amount of money you get was not quite enough to pay rent, and holiday fee, so I moved into the countrysides which had varieties of farm jobs. Sure there were easy jobs like in the cities, but the number of shops, and restaurants are quite small, and they were hiring mostly local people rather than working holiday workers. There I got a farm hand job in the tomato field. It was really hard job. We needed to work from 7 am when the sun rises to 6 pm when the sun sets. It was hard for my poor body, too. That is why I think most people move to the cities rather than stay in the countrysides.
Although I am not sure if there is a possibility to reverse this event, I think there are quite a lot of good experience you can only get in the countrysides. One thing I can say is the people and the living pace are slower, and more relaxed in countrysides than in the cities. For example like I myself said, I prefer living in the countrysides than in the cities. In fact I moved to Edmonton in Canada, which is a city, but I'd say more like a town, but a lot more relaxed than Tokyo where I used to live. Sometimes people living in the crazy fast cities like Tokyo, New York, and etc actually want to slow down the pace to more relaxing cities, or countrysides. If we want to reverse this movement, I think you need to advertise what benefits you can get in the countrysides. For example, they have quite magnificent views, good benefits to raise your kids, and so on. I think it can really reverse the movement because nowadays people are so interested in the educations of their kids, so scientifically we need to prove that living in the countrysides, and raising the children can be really beneficial for them. I myself have 2 children, and I can feel the benefits of living in the countrysides. The more free time they have, the more creative they become, and I strongly believe the more creative they are, the more happier they can lead their lives.
As a result, I believe that we can reverse, or slow down the speed of the movement of the people from the countrysides into the cities if we empharsise the benefits of raising kids in the countrysides more.",,,,,,7.5,"In recent years, many people have been choosing to move from rural areas to big cities, and this shift is starting to create some problems in urban centers. One major reason people decide to leave the countryside is because cities seem to offer better opportunities, such as more types of jobs and easier access to things like good schools, hospitals, and entertainment. In my opinion, it can feel boring living in the countryside, and sometimes even basic services like transportation or high-speed internet are lacking. For example, I remember visiting my cousin who lives in a small village, and she has to travel long distances just to buy clothes or see a doctor. Another big attraction of the city is meeting new friends and experiencing a faster pace of life, which is appealing to many young people. However, when too many people gather in cities, problems like traffic jams, high rent, and pollution start to get worse. To help reverse this trend, governments could focus on improving what life is like in the countryside. For instance, if better internet and more job opportunities were available in rural areas, people might choose to stay or even move back. I think if we celebrate the unique things about countryside life, like fresh air, beautiful nature, and a stronger sense of community, and if more support is given to rural schools and businesses, it might help slow down or even reverse this movement from villages to cities."
835,2,"The movement of people from the countryside into the cities is happening in many parts of the world, resulting in the problems, especially in cities.What are the causes of this movement, and how can it be reversedGive reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays all over the world more and more families immigrate from rural to urban areas and such a situation leads to a number of undesirable consequences for city residents and regions in general. In this essay I shall try to cover some reasons for this trend as well as provide a number of solutions.
To start with, we have to consider the logic behind this movement. Firstly, as a rule, the countryside does not have enough educational institutions, so after finishing high school most students are obliged to move to other parts of the country in order to obtain higher education and, eventually, apply for well-paid jobs that are available only in bigger cities. Secondly, despite being provided with basic services, people still feel the lack of entertainment facilities, such as cinemas, theaters and others. In other words, most of the rural population is bored and have nothing else to do, that is why they are bound to immigrate to urban areas.
Luckily, there are a number of solutions, which could be implemented and, hopefully, they can solve or, at least, ease the situation. Initially, it is vitally important that the government allocates more funds to rural areas and use this money for construction of public amenities such as hospitals, schools, kindergartens, and others. If those facilities were introduced, then villagers would have fewer incentives to move. The second option that we have to consider is to promote living in the countryside by providing tax cuts, subsidies and other measures of economic stimulation, which could prove to be effective in the long run.
All things considered, it can be clearly seen that the lack of facilities and money are the two most important reasons as to why more villagers move to the cities. Unless the government provides a number of economic incentives along with public facilities, it might be difficult to overturn this trend.",,,,,,7.5,"Migration from rural areas to large cities is a widespread issue that introduces significant challenges, particularly for urban centers, and in this essay I will explore the main motivators for this movement as well as ways to address it. Primarily, one key reason for rural-to-urban migration is the scarcity of good job opportunities in the countryside; many small towns can only offer work in agriculture or local services, which may not be well-paid or consistent. Furthermore, cities often provide better access to healthcare and technical advancements, making urban living very attractive, especially for young families seeking improved standards of living. Another factor contributing to this trend is the overall lack of infrastructure in villages, notably poor transportation links and limited social outlets, which can lead to feelings of isolation. To reverse this movement, I think the government should invest more heavily in rural development by building modern schools, hospitals, and even supporting small businesses to create more jobs locally. Additionally, organizing community events and building sports or cultural centers could enhance social life in villages and make them more attractive places to stay. In conclusion, better employment prospects and superior urban infrastructure are the main reasons for population shifts from the countryside, but with government support and increased investment, life in rural areas could become much more appealing, thereby reducing the pace of urbanization."
837,2,"Many people today, especially in the developed world, are choosing to have fewer children, or none at all.Why is this happening, and do you think it is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Weather to have children or not is one of the most important questions young adults have to ask themselfs nowadays. Overpopulation is one of the many global problems next to climate change, and poverty.
In my opinion, the need to have children roots back to us being nothing more, but civilised animals. Animals have one goal above all; reproduce. This is why in many cultures, men and women who cannot have chlidren are seen as disabled, or sick. Nowadays, modern values changed our perspective, having children is often seen as a necessity for a happy, and successful life.
It is important to recognise the problems the developed world faces. There is smoke in the air, plastic pollution everywhere, poverty in third world countries, and many other factors that make Earth a terrible place for many. Above all, the life we give birth to will have to eat, drink, and consume just like everyone else, using more and more of the already limited resources, generating more and more trash.
Many people argue that the above mentioned points are a pessimistic and unrealistic. Humans have to reproduce, to keep the species from extintion. And truthfully the only way to do that, is to give birth as many kids as possible. This issue lies deep in our society; here in Hungary, a family is rewared almost 30000 USD if they have 3 or more kids. This means that many people have children because they get money for it, and they are also seen socially accepted.
I believe modern day intelligence goes further than IQ points and money earned. We have to recognise the problems created, overpopulation being one of them. While I do not believe that we should not have kids, I think there should be careful planning involved and self-reflection before giving birth to new life.",,,,,,5.5,"In recent years, more people in wealthy countries are deciding to have fewer children, or even choosing not to become parents at all, and there are several factors behind this shift. One major reason is the rising cost of living; raising a child today involves significant expenses for healthcare, education, housing, and extracurricular activities, and many couples feel financially unprepared for such a burden. Furthermore, changing social values have placed greater emphasis on personal fulfillment and career development, with many individuals wanting to travel, pursue hobbies, and focus on their professional lives rather than taking on the long-term responsibilities of parenthood. Environmental concerns also play a role, as some people worry that bringing more children into the world will increase strain on the planet’s finite resources and exacerbate issues like climate change. For example, a close friend of mine recently decided against having children because she wanted to reduce her carbon footprint and dedicate her time to volunteering for wildlife conservation. Whether this trend is positive or negative depends on perspective; on one hand, fewer children can mean a less crowded planet and more resources per person, but on the other, it might lead to aging populations and labor shortages in the future. I believe that while everyone should have the freedom to choose what’s right for them, it is crucial for societies to thoughtfully balance personal desires with the long-term needs of their communities."
839,2,"Boxing is a blood sport which often results in physical injury. It is inappropriate for this sport to exist in the modern age.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Boxing is really dangerous sport which usually leads to physical injuries. However, I do not agree that it is inappropriate for the modern age to has such a sport, since it is a huge part of our culture and many people actually enjoy watching it.
To begin with, boxing is depicted as blood but fair and honorable sport in different kinds of art, such as literature and cinema. For instance, Ernest Hemingway has a number of stories related to this sport in his book ""Men Without Women"", and there are also various movies about boxing. A one may become boxer for different reasons: it could be encouraged by existing culture, it could be a wish to fight fairly without any lie which is rarely achievable in life outside sport, or a way to throw out internal aggression. In any way, it is his or her freedom of choise whether to take part in this sport or not, and I believe it is absolutely not appropriate to forbid people boxing.
Furthermore, people actually like watching boxing, otherwise it would not be so popular. They associate themselves with a sportsman and experience rush and adrenaline along with him. After a competetion, fans usually feel relief as after great movie, except they know that all the action took place in real life, which is not a case for movies. This perception of reality increases the feelings greatly, leading to more fascinating experience.
In the end, I want to underline this again: I believe that boxing is totally appropriete for the modern world, along with other extreme sports, and its cancellation would be absolutely unfair and generally bad, even though it is undisputably very injury-prone.",,,,,,5.5,"While it is true that boxing often leads to serious injuries, I do not agree that this sport is no longer appropriate for the modern world, because it has significant cultural value and provides opportunities for many people. To start with, boxing has a long history and is deeply woven into the fabric of society in many countries. Many famous figures, such as Muhammad Ali, have inspired millions with their achievements in the ring, and these stories continue to motivate people today. Additionally, boxing is not just about violence; it requires discipline, technique, and respect for one's opponent, which are important values. For many participants, boxing is also a way out of poverty, helping them build a better life through hard work and dedication. Of course, the risks are high, but safety rules and equipment have improved over the years, and athletes are aware of what they are signing up for. Just like other dangerous activities such as rock climbing or football, it comes down to personal choice. In conclusion, despite the dangers, I think boxing should continue to exist, as it brings value both to individuals and to culture as a whole, and banning it would take away important freedoms."
841,2,"Boxing is a blood sport which often results in physical injury. It is inappropriate for this sport to exist in the modern age.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Boxing is a dangerous kind of sport that may cause physical injury. Some people tend to believe that this sport should not exist nowadays. This controversial statement has both advantages and disadvantages, which will be discussed in this essay.
A tremendous number of people think that boxing is an excellent way to fit a body and improve coordination. For instance, if parents want their kids to know how to defend themselves, they let them attend boxing masterclasses. However, the main aim for parents is to find a skilled, experienced coach for their children. They may think if a teacher is an expert, their kids will not suffer during training. Notwithstanding, it does not always work like that.
On the other hand, a lot of people completely disagree that boxing as a business industry has a right to exist in the modern world. They are convinced that people who fight should not suffer because of the wishes of rich people who enjoy the show. For example, if a young person gets a physical injury during a fight, he will probably get money for that; however, it does not mean that he will get better after the final battle. Also, people who protest against this blood sport probably dislike advertisements related to boxing. They may think that even these videos impact people's behaviour and motivate them to commit violence against others.
In conclusion, boxing is a part of the blood business that should be forbidden in the modern age. From my point of view, if a person wants boxing nowadays, there are a lot of different ways to do it, like VR simulation, without harming other people.",,,,,,7.0,"Boxing has long been considered one of the most dangerous sports, and many people think it is no longer suitable for our modern society. Those who support boxing argue that it teaches discipline, builds fitness, and gives individuals a way to escape difficult life situations. For example, some young people find purpose and structure in their lives through training and competing, as the dedication required can steer them away from trouble. At the same time, however, it is easy to see why people oppose boxing, especially because of the risk of serious injuries such as brain trauma and broken bones. Observing a match, one can immediately recognize that harm is almost unavoidable, and sometimes boxers suffer lifelong health consequences. Critics believe that encouraging such violence for public entertainment is unethical, and that modern entertainment should no longer require two people hurting each other. On balance, although boxing can have positive influences for some, I lean toward the view that its dangerous nature makes it inappropriate today, and society should focus on safer ways to achieve the same benefits."
843,2,"Boxing is a blood sport which often results in physical injury. It is inappropriate for this sport to exist in the modern age.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Boxing is a sport that draws many visitors and a steady stream of new athlets. But that might be suprising, since it is a violent sport that often results in serious injuries of the participants. As a developed society, who at large condemns fighting, the continued interest can be seen as undermining our values and beliefs.
While using fists to communicate is definitely inappropriate people claim, that this is not what happens in a boxing match. Everybody who steps into the ring consents to the physical altercation and is aware of the risks associated with it. Furthermore, there are precautions taken and a jury in session to make sure nobody gets seriously hurt. Those points cause many fans of the sport to claim, that it is not so differnt to most other sports since there is always a possibility to get hurt. Additionally, one might argue that what two consenting adults do in there past time or as their job is just nobody elses business.
On the other hand, people who don't think boxing should continue, often are convinced that society sets the wrong incentives. The promise of fame and quick money that is often associated with a career in boxing might tempt some to disregard their long-term health for short-term gain. Since socially disadvantaged individuals are less likely to have alternative prospects, one might argue that it is not a real choice after all. Another concern of critics is the corruption of the audience. Frequent exposure to violent entertainment is often connected to a higher likelyhood to become violent.
While I can understand that boxing is not for everyone, I think that the personal freedom of everyone involved should be respected. Because at the end, nobody is forced to watch or take part in a boxing match.",,,,,,6.5,"Boxing, frequently criticized due to its violent nature and risk of serious injury, is believed by some to be a relic of a less civilized time. However, I do not think it is inappropriate for this sport to exist today. Like many other high-risk activities such as rock climbing or motor racing, boxing is fundamentally based on the informed consent of the participants, who are trained and understand the dangers involved. In fact, professional boxing organizations enforce strict safety rules and medical protocols to minimize harm. Many fans argue that the sport builds discipline, mental strength, and provides countless young people—often from disadvantaged backgrounds—an opportunity to find purpose and escape difficult circumstances. Admittedly, the lure of quick fame and fortune does have drawbacks, as does the fact that some spectators become desensitized to violence, but these issues are present in other areas of entertainment and sport as well. Ultimately, as long as there are regulations to protect boxers and participation is voluntary, I believe society should respect their choice and continue to allow boxing."

It is inappropriate for this sport to exist in the modern age.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","There is debatable issue as to whether boxing, a seemingly bloody sport, should be excluded from the modern society. As far as I am concerned, the attempt to remove boxing from the current age is utterly unjustified.
Admittedly, boxing is often associated with various disturbing factors, such as foul language, disregard to rivals, violent punches and inelegant appearance as a result of intense physical contacts. However, such gory scenes may frequently take place in underground boxing games which are barely recognised by the professional community of boxing and by the legal system. Unlike underground boxing, professional boxing upholds moral principles and universal values, for examples, respect to opponents, obedience of rules, etc. Also, professional boxers are protected by safety equipment and judges who may stop the game when witnessing any player suffering serious injuries. Therefore, the health hazards involved in boxing games may not be as severe as the public assumes.
Another reason reinforcing my position is that boxing already enjoys considerable popularity around the world and plays an important part in people's entertainment, as exemplified by the successful ticket sales of most boxing games and high audience rating of TV programmes broadcasting boxing matches. Given such popularity of boxing, the removal of this sport may cause widespread dissatisfaction and complaint.
To draw a conclusion, the exclusion of boxing is completely groundless and irrational, given the safety protection, sportmanship and popularity as reflected in this sport. I expect in the future, more views could arise to furnish the understanding in this regard.",,,,,,7.5,"There is considerable debate regarding whether boxing, as a physically violent sport prone to injury, has a place in contemporary society. Personally, I disagree with the proposition that boxing should be abolished for several substantive reasons. While it is undeniable that boxing can lead to injuries and even long-term health complications, the sport is tightly regulated at the professional level, with strict safety protocols, medical supervision, and clear rules designed to protect the athletes. Modern boxing organizations mandate the use of protective gear and grant referees the authority to stop matches if a competitor is in danger, thereby minimizing extreme risks. Furthermore, boxing offers significant benefits such as instilling discipline, promoting physical fitness, and providing opportunities for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve success and recognition. Notably, many renowned boxers—such as Manny Pacquiao and Muhammad Ali—have used their boxing careers to make positive contributions to society. Finally, boxing remains deeply embedded in culture and enjoys a passionate global following, with countless fans regarding the sport not solely as a spectacle of violence but as a testament to strategy, resilience, and sportsmanship. In light of these factors, eliminating boxing from modern society would disregard its regulated environment, its ability to inspire and uplift, and its lasting cultural significance."

For instance, many young people have found new direction in life by joining local boxing clubs instead of getting involved in negative behaviors, learning valuable life skills such as perseverance and respect. Furthermore, even though injuries happen in boxing, the same risk also exists in other popular sports such as soccer, cricket, or even skateboarding, thereby making it unfair to single out boxing for being dangerous.

851,2,Competitiveness is a positive quality for people in most societies. How does competitiveness affect individuals? Is it a positive or negative trend?,"There are many factors to encourage the quality of societies, some people believe that competitiveness is the main factor to improve communities. The following essay will focus on importance of competitiveness on individuals and cite my opinion which believe that it is a positive trend to develop societies.
First of all, if you want to improve a skill of an individual in the differnet aspects of life like sport, you should play him with higher level to develop his talent and get best of him. For example ,a famous tennis table player from my town said in an interview, that he improved his talent when he played against his older brother, he was working hard in training sessions to reach the higher level, the standard that his brother plays in order to beat him and win games. The competetion between him and his brother lift up his skills and strenthgen his mentality.
secondly, competitions may create good atmosphere and healthy climate for children to improve thier abilitie in study. For example, my daughter and her friends in the class were struggling in studying math, the math teacher found a way to make the math more interesting for students, the teacher announced for a competition every day at the end of lesson, she writes an equations on the board and gives prizes for students who can solve them. Nowadays, my daughter is enjoying to solve math problems. Furthermore, competitions can improve people's career, and increase company's outcome, some managers tend to encourage competitiveness between employers to have more benefits for company and workers as well.
To conclude, competitiveness enables people to improve their talents and students to love what they study, also employers will develop their skills, as a result of that most societies will get more benefits of this trend.",,,,,,6.0,"Competitiveness plays an important role in many societies because it motivates people to do their best and reach new heights. On an individual level, when someone is surrounded by others who are striving to succeed, it can push them to work harder, practice more, or study with greater focus, all of which lead to personal development. For instance, one of my classmates who always wanted to get the best grades was inspired to study more seriously because he noticed other students in our class were also dedicated, and as a result, his performance noticeably improved. Furthermore, a competitive environment can make activities more enjoyable and give people a sense of achievement when they accomplish their goals. However, competitiveness can also have negative effects if it becomes too intense, leading people to feel stressed or anxious if they are not always on top. Some people may compare themselves too much with others, which can sometimes decrease their confidence. Even so, I believe that, when managed properly, competitiveness is a positive trend because it pushes individuals beyond their comfort zones and ultimately helps both people and communities advance."
853,2,Competitiveness is a positive quality for people in most societies. How does competitiveness affect individuals? Is it a positive or negative trend?,"Competitiveness is a desirable quality for individuals. This essay will analyse the effects of competitiveness on people and illuminate my view as to whether the eagerness of competition represents an auspicious or ominous tendency.
There are mainly two types of influence exerted by competitiveness on people. The most prominent repercussion resides in that the desire of competition drives people to work or study more diligently in order to stand out from the rest and achieve success. Such diligence enables people to accumulate sufficient experience that helps them improve capabilities and obtain better results. Apart from that, another important effect of competitiveness is that competitors may seek considerable pleasure in competition, especially when defeating competent rivals and obtaining hard-earned victories. Such success makes people realise how excellent they are and gives them tremendous satisfaction. Even if losing the competition, people may still be satisfied with such a precious opportunity that helps them understand their disadvantages and thus, encourages them to work harder.
As far as I am concerned, I opine that competitiveness is a positive phenomenon, because it not only helps people become industrious learners or workers with sufficient experience and great potential of making progress, but also makes their daily lives more enjoyable as beating strong opponents may give them a unique sense of satisfaction. Therefore, I think that the importance of competitiveness should never be underestimated.
To sum up, the effects of competitiveness can be manifested by the impetus driving people to work or study harder, and the unique pleasure of competing against strong rivals. Personally, I hold that this is an auspicious trend.",,,,,,8.5,"Competitiveness is widely regarded as a beneficial attribute in modern society. This essay will discuss how competitiveness influences individuals and express my viewpoint regarding whether it should be perceived as a favourable or adverse development. To begin with, competitiveness often motivates individuals to elevate their performance in various aspects of life, such as academics, work, or sports. By striving to exceed others or their own past achievements, people frequently set higher goals, leading them to exert greater effort and perseverance. This can result in increased skill, knowledge, and personal growth. In addition, competitiveness can foster innovation and creativity, since the drive to outdo others may stimulate new ideas and approaches. However, competitiveness may also bring about negative consequences; for example, excessive rivalry can lead to stress, anxiety, or damaged relationships, particularly when individuals become overly focused on winning at all costs. Despite these potential downsides, I believe that competitiveness, on balance, is a positive force. It encourages people to challenge themselves and discover their true potential, while also enriching society through improved outcomes and dynamic progress. In conclusion, although competitiveness can sometimes have harmful effects, its capacity to drive improvement and ambition makes it a valuable trend in contemporary life."

Is it a positive or negative trend?,"In recent years there has been a great deal of discussion about competition. A number of people are of the opinion that competitiveness ought to be in a modern society. Personally, I assume that it is a great opportunity for people to develop their skills, relationships, imrove the level of knowledge and become a leader in different spheres. In this essay, I shall examine the way it has an influence on people and inderstand whether it is a beneficial quality.
Analyzing the impact of competitiveness, I agree that it helps people with trying to give all the best and not let another person to win. Moreover, if there were no competitiveness at my school, I would not try to do various projects or developing my skills to be an excellent student. This quality helps me always raise the bar even more. Also, I know that many famous brends such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci compete with each other all the time to take a leadership position in a fashion world.
As for being positive or negative, I am of the opinion that competitiveness is a positive trend due to numerous reasons. First of all, analyzing sports competition, I understand that it is a social process, depending on the biological and social changes that all people are going through. Secondly, in an age of social media and growing individualism, time spent interacting and communicating with others is reducing. However, our ability to work with others to achieve a common goal is an essential skill to develop, not only in sport but in life.
In coclusion, a competition can improve people's all-round development while it can give exceeding pressure on them more than they can deal with. However, in my opinion, I tend to believe that the benefits of competition outweigh its disadvantages.",,,,,,6.0,"The concept of competitiveness has become more significant as modern societies place a higher value on personal achievement. Some believe it propels individuals to reach greater heights, while others argue it may cause unnecessary stress. Personally, I think competitiveness mostly benefits individuals by inspiring them to exceed their limitations and pursue self-improvement. For example, during my time at university, constant competition with classmates motivated me to study harder and search for innovative solutions to problems. In the professional world, companies such as Apple and Samsung compete with one another, which results in better products and more technological innovation for consumers. However, too much competitiveness sometimes leads to anxiety, jealousy, or poor teamwork, especially when people become obsessed with winning. Nevertheless, if managed properly, competitiveness encourages learning, fosters perseverance, and often brings out the best in people. In conclusion, while competitiveness can occasionally have negative consequences, I believe that its positive effects for personal and societal progress make it an overwhelmingly beneficial trend."

No doubt about a positive effect on societies, but when we start to argue about the effect on individuals, it becomes more controversial. This essay will argue the drawbacks of competitiveness for individuals, especially from the perspective of Japanese modern society and typical Japanese office workers. I believe that cooperativeness and uniqueness are sometimes more important attitude than competitiveness.
Firstly, competitiveness causes less diversity. If there is a competition, there must be the same evaluation metrics to differentiate winners and losers. The evaluation procedure needs to limit the metrics into specific aspects of the human being. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to prove that the metrics are proper for all of the possible cases and effective for the HR evaluation. For example, Japanese companies are likely to judge quantitatively based on the numbers related to performance. However, how can we evaluate the cooperativity or the non-quantitative performance like in creative jobs? Most Japanese companies adopted the HR evaluation methods based on average working hours per day and number of reports monthly. That’s why the Japanese tend to overwork to fulfill this requirement. In addition, as a result of placing more importance in quantity of reports, rather than quality, Japanese employees are prone to choose easy and short-term tasks or outsourcing instead of building by their own methods. This tendency causes fewer complicated and long-term tasks.
Secondly, competitiveness causes less cooperativeness. Fewer people volunteer to play a disadvantageous role for smooth teamwork. Moreover, some people play an evil role by blaming or cheating the competitors in order to be superior to them. As a consequence, overall efficiency will decline and some people will be overestimated. Even if there are no problems temporarily, the long-lasting large companies will eventually become corrupt, and those who have the most political power, rather than real power, will remain at the top.
Consequently, competitiveness is the basis of capitalism which brings us a brighter and more convenient society, however, biased evaluation and less cooperative working environment possibly drive people into nervous breakdowns. Karoshi, overwork death derived from too much stress and less sleeping, is one of the most serious social problems in Japan. We may need to rethink about the competitiveness.",,,,,,7.5,"Competitiveness is often celebrated as a driving force behind personal achievement and societal progress, yet its impact on individuals can be both profound and complicated. In many modern societies, particularly in places like South Korea, the drive to outdo others shapes educational systems and workplace cultures alike, leading to widespread stress and burnout. While a competitive spirit can motivate people to learn new skills and push past their limits, it can also result in narrow definitions of success, often measured by test scores or productivity milestones. This focus on ranking and comparison tends to devalue qualities such as collaboration and empathy, which are essential in teams and for creative problem-solving. For example, in South Korean high schools, students often sacrifice personal hobbies and social relationships to perform better than their peers on exams, and this pattern often continues into corporate life. As a result, many individuals become isolated or experience mental health issues, undermining both personal well-being and social cohesion. While some degree of competition is necessary for innovation and improvement, an excessive focus on outpacing others can ultimately erode the foundations of trust and shared purpose, which are just as important for a thriving society. Thus, although competitiveness has certain advantages, its negative effects on individuals’ happiness, cooperation, and mental health suggest that societies should strive for a better balance between competing and collaborating."

However, the effects of competitiveness on individuals are more complicated than they may appear on the surface, and whether it is a positive or negative trend depends greatly on context. While healthy competition can encourage personal growth and excellence, excessive focus on outperforming others can create significant stress and undermine well-being. For instance, in many workplaces, employees are rewarded for surpassing colleagues instead of cooperating with them, which can lead to a loss of trust and less willingness to share knowledge. In such an environment, creative thinking and teamwork often become secondary to the pursuit of personal recognition. This problem can be observed in South Korean academia, where students are under relentless pressure to outperform one another on highly competitive exams. Though the country has excellent educational outcomes, many students experience mental health issues, and some even disengage from social life altogether. On the other hand, a moderate level of competitiveness can inspire people to set higher goals and reach their potential, provided it is balanced with supportive structures and the recognition of diverse talents. In conclusion, while competitiveness has contributed greatly to development and efficiency, its impact on individuals should be carefully managed to avoid negative consequences like alienation, stress, and a lack of true collaboration."
861,2,"Traffic and housing problems could be solved by moving large companies, factories and their employees to the countryside.Do you agree or disagree?","Many metropolises are facing challenges, including traffic gams and serious lacking of housing available for families to live, particular in the developed countries. The governments are looking for a way to lessen the volume of traffic in the cities and to increase the number of housing provision over the metropolises. Some people advocate the businesses including large corporations and factories along with their employees moving to the suburbs which is the best way to figure out the metropolitan problems. Is this a sheer solution for these challenges faced by the cities?
Economy boom in a country is accompanied with a number of problems incurred in the cities due to the multitudes living in there. It is no wonder that metropolises represent more job opportunities available and better education system to next generations. These are strong pull factors appealing people to stay in the cities despite the higher cost in living. A larger number of populations in the cities not only result in a severe shortage of housing where there is a higher demand of housing over the available supply, but also bring the higher volume of traffic across the cities, particular in a peak hour when a thousand and one employees commuting to work and students going to schools. Some people believe the working location shifting to rural areas is a solution that enables to lessen the frequent usage of roads in cities. Simultaneously, it is assumed that the housing issue can be solved naturally arising from the migration of their employees into the suburban town next to their working place.
The business allocated to suburbs alone is rarely considered enough to tackle these problems. A place to live requires the basic facilities to serve for clothing, food, housing and transportation which are basic needs of human. If there is a working place and residential area only in the suburban town without any infrastructures, people have no choice to drive their vehicles back and forth between cities and their living places for the general consumption. As a consequence, the traffic congestion in cities will be worsen combining with the significant deterioration of air quality in the countryside due to an increase in the emission of the greenhouse gases. Therefore, the governments play a key role to establish a neighborhood which could be self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas. This may be a feasible and effective way to minimize the metropolitan issues.
My own view is that the shifting strategies in suburbs can help lessen the challenges faced by metropolises. But the governments should take the smart planning into consideration in which the employment bases with the living infrastructures are developed in the suburban town.",,,,,,6.5,"Traffic and housing issues have become two of the most pressing concerns in major cities worldwide, leading some to argue that relocating large companies, factories, and their employees to the countryside could offer a solution. While at first glance this proposal might promise relief, the reality is far more complex. The clustering of job opportunities and better social amenities in urban centers is a strong magnet for populations, driving both high housing demand and overwhelming the transportation networks. If organizations and their workers move to rural areas, the immediate effect may be some reduction in urban congestion and housing shortages. However, this approach ignores the need for robust infrastructure in the countryside, such as roads, public transport, schools, and healthcare, which do not currently exist at the same scale as cities. Without thoughtful development of comprehensive facilities, employees may be forced to commute long distances or rely on city resources, merely shifting the problem elsewhere or even exacerbating it through increased traffic between rural and urban areas. Moreover, sudden population growth in once-quiet rural communities can strain local resources and alter the environment, potentially leading to new sets of difficulties. In my opinion, although relocating companies to the countryside can play a role in alleviating some urban stress, it is not a standalone solution. Governments must couple such moves with careful urban and regional planning, ensuring that employment bases are matched with sustainable housing, infrastructure, and social services to prevent recreating the same problems outside the city. Only a balanced, long-term approach can truly address the root causes of metropolitan traffic and housing issues."
863,2,"Traffic and housing problems could be solved by moving large companies, factories and their employees to the countryside.Do you agree or disagree?","It is often argued that by moving large companies,factories and it employees,traffic and housing problems could be irradicated.I completely agree to this fact that these problems could be solved by taking this step.
Traffic and housing problems has been a major problem in big cities due to the increasing population in these areas.The main contribution to the rapidly growing population are the multinational companies and the industries that have been set in the cities.These companies have a thousands of employees.As a result,if these companies are established in cities,it will lead to lot of traffic.For example,mumbai,a major city in India has uncontrollable traffic due to the vast IT sector present there.It has been very difficult for the people living in mumbai to travel even the shortest distances as it takes a lot of time to move from one place to another.The demand for housing also increases due to large number of employees from industries and huge companies which inturn leads to drastic increase in the expenses for housing.As a result,they have to compromise for small houses due to high rents.
The only solution for this problem is by mobilising the big companies and industries to countryside which has a lot of empty lands.By taking this step,it is both benefitial to the companies as well as the employees.The cost of establishment of the companies will be significantly low in the outskirts of the cities and the rural areas compared to the city.The employees also save a lot of time due to relatively less traffic and they also benefit to a large extent by low housing exenses.The traffic, housing problems and the pollution in the cities will also be reduced by taking this initiative.
To conclude,the employees, the people in the citiesand the companies as a whole could benefit by mobilising the industries and multinational companies from the cities to the country side due to the above reasons.",,,,,,6.5,"Many people believe that relocating large businesses, factories, and their workers to rural areas could help solve the traffic and housing problems experienced in cities. I fully agree with this opinion, as moving companies out of urban areas will greatly reduce congestion and the struggle to find affordable homes. The main reason big cities suffer from heavy traffic and expensive, overcrowded housing is the high concentration of major companies, which attract thousands of employees into the city every day. For instance, in cities like Beijing and London, roads are always jammed during rush hours, mainly because everyone is heading to a few business hubs located downtown. This daily migration not only slows down transportation but also puts pressure on public transit and raises pollution levels. Moreover, the large number of workers searching for housing near their offices has pushed rental prices to unaffordable rates for many people, often forcing them into cramped living conditions. By moving these companies to the countryside where land is more available and cheaper, the pressure on urban infrastructure will decrease. Employees can enjoy larger homes at lower costs, companies will benefit from lower land and construction prices, and cities can potentially become less crowded and more pleasant for those who remain. Therefore, I believe that encouraging firms and their staff to relocate to rural areas is an effective way to tackle the persistent issues of urban traffic and housing shortages."
865,2,"Some people think that it is more beneficial to take part in sports which are played in teams, like football, while other people think that taking part in individual sports, like tennis or swimming, is better. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Sport play an essential role in shaping the personality of individual. Some people believe that sports which are played in teams are more beneficial like football, while others think that solo sports like tennis or swimming is better. The following essay will discuss both arguments and give my opinion that sports which are played in teams have more advantages over solo sport activites.
First of all, there is no doubt that the individual sport activities enahnce people confidence. It helps building the personality and strentghen the mentality of the individuals. For examole, one role model in my home country was playing tennis table, he mentioned once in an interview, that sport helped him not only to win trophies but it raised his mental strength and shaped his pesonality.
However, some people believe that, sports which are played in teams
have more advantages and all community will get the benefits. Soccer, for example, will help the players specifically the young children to understand working together and sharing the responsibility. In addition people will grow with better understanding to the concept of sharing achievements which can improve all the community. For instance, i was a member of soccer team in high school, me and my friends were taught, in order to win games we should put plans together and work as one unit. Furthermore, it helps me later in my career to understand the meaning of leadership and how the sharing responsibility and working together could bring the success to our endeavour.
To conclude, solo sport can bring proud and honour to individuals but
sports which played in teams teach people the meaning of working together which will improve the community in the future.",,,,,,6.0,"There are different opinions when it comes to choosing between team sports and individual sports. On one hand, individual sports like tennis or swimming can help a person gain self-discipline and push themselves to improve since they are solely responsible for their results. For example, when someone practices swimming, they learn how to set personal goals and work hard to achieve them, which can help boost their confidence and determination. On the other hand, team sports such as basketball or football teach people how to work with others and value cooperation. Being part of a team requires communication, understanding, and the ability to handle both winning and losing together, which are useful skills not only in sports but also in life and work situations. Personally, I believe that team sports are more beneficial overall, because they nurture social skills and a sense of community, which are important for both young people and adults. In the end, while both types of sports have their own advantages, taking part in a team sport has a bigger impact on developing important life skills."

This is an issue that considerably affects our choices in athletism and consequently our mode of living.This essay will consider whether the the overall effect of being a member of a sports team is positive or negative.
It is an undeniable fact that by taking part in teams benefits a lot someone's social prowess. That is owing to the fact that social skills are inextricably linked to the way individuals cooperate with each other.A prime example is the athletes in competitions who pay respect to the opponent.Notwithstanding the fact that people realize how they are suppose to behave to others , there is a handful of people for whom doing sports alone offers them more relaxation.
In addition, being a part of a team plays a pivotal role in creating relationships .That is due to the fact that people interact with each other and learn about the personality traits of the team members. In spite of the fact that team provide the chance to become more social , there are team of low quality in which individuals may feel disturbed. A typical example is teams consisted of children at a tender age which may treat unfairly some other members given they differ in color or religious outlook.
In conclusion , it is reasonable to maintain that sports that require participating in teams is not less disadvantageous than individual sports .",,,,,,7.5,"There are those who argue that engaging in team sports such as football is more advantageous, while others believe that solo activities like swimming or tennis are better for individuals. This topic is important because it concerns not only physical health but also the development of interpersonal and personal skills. Participating in a team sport aids in teaching valuable lessons such as cooperation, communication, and shared responsibility, as players must rely on each other to achieve common goals. An example is how football teammates coordinate and motivate one another during a match. However, not everyone prefers or thrives in a group setting, and for some, individual sports offer greater opportunities for personal discipline and mental focus. In tennis or swimming, athletes are solely accountable for their own progress, which can help them develop independence and a strong sense of self-motivation. Nonetheless, individual sports may sometimes feel isolating, as athletes do not always share their achievements or failures with others. In my opinion, both types of sports have their unique benefits, but team sports are somewhat more helpful overall because they not only encourage physical fitness but also contribute to the building of essential social skills that are useful in many aspects of life."
869,2,Some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. Others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. On the other hand, others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. This essay will discuss both views and my opinion.
Some people insist that punishment is a priority as culprits have gone agaisnt ones country's law. When they serve more years in prison, there is no chance for them to re-commit crime. In addition, some suppose that those who can not afford themselves, will feel better in the prison. As prisoners have to live in a systmatized cycle, they do not need to plan their budget and life. There is interview with an offender who continuously commits crime to go back to the prison.
Contemporarily, others say that there are better ways to reduce crime, such as rehabiliation and education. Most offenders lack moral value. Furthermore, they mostly have wrong mindsets or thoughts as some have never been educated properly. Therefore, other people think that education is better way to improve prisoners' behaviour. Society ought to give an opportunity to re-start their life again.
I agree more with the second view. Obviously, we have to punish those people whoever break the law. However, punishment should not be a priority. Education is important. Community need to lead a way for them so that they can re-born as a totally different person. There is a statistics of crimes rates in the United States of America which implicits that strict punishment and longer prison sentences reversely led to an increase in crime rates. Therefore, the government needs to concentrate more on education and rehabiliation rather than security and control.",,,,,,6.5,"Some people argue that giving longer prison sentences is the most effective way to reduce crime. They believe that strict punishment discourages people from breaking the law, as the threat of more time in prison acts as a strong warning. This group also feels that when criminals are locked up for longer, society becomes safer because these individuals are not free to commit more crimes. On the other hand, others think there are better solutions to reduce crime, such as investing in prevention and support. They argue that many who commit crimes have difficult backgrounds, like poverty or lack of education, and that programs for rehabilitation or job training can help people avoid becoming repeat offenders. In my opinion, while prison is necessary for serious crimes, it should not be the only solution. Focusing on education, mental health support, and providing opportunities for those at risk can address the root reasons for crime and help people make better choices. Therefore, I support the idea that combining fair punishment with helpful programs is the best path to creating a safer community."

In this essay I am going to discuss the reason why crims is beeng evrey our and I will discuss how to reduce it.
I will start with offenese of at least 15 years. sorlly there are a lot of people in these day are killing a men or a gril he should sbeand his life in prison, becouse if they didnt let them in jail than they will be a serial killer and they will kill a lots of people. And also the money laundering in their types, the Bank should say somthing about this crime becouse there are people don't no about it so wehen the bank see inflating in the bank account they most inform the officil authority.
I will discuss now about crimes with a sentence of less than 10 years, starting with thief the polise shoild safe people from them, and I see if they put a cameras every our than that will stop them form steling and the secand crime is drugs sell and these is more denger of the thief becouse they are not only 1, 2 they do a groub to sell it like mafiea.
In opinion, I see that the crimes start with movie example, there are a lot of under 16 see a movie about serial killer so wehen he becam a man he kills becous this's what he see wehen he was chaild so we should be responsible for what our children see and every person who commits a crime will be held accountable according to what his crime is.",,,,,,5.0,"There are many ideas about the best way to stop crime in our society. Some people think that giving longer prison sentences will make criminals afraid and so they will not do bad things. They believe that if a person knows he will be in jail for a long time if caught, he will think twice before stealing or hurting someone. On the other hand, some people say that putting people in jail for many years does not fix the real reasons for crime. They think if we teach people, give them jobs, and help them with their problems like drugs or poverty, then less people will want to do crime in the first place. In my idea, both ways can help but just one is not enough. For big crimes like killing, maybe prison is needed, but for small crimes or young people, it is better to help them learn a better life. In the end, to really stop crime society must work together and not only use prison as the answer."

Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"There is an opinion which is that the longer prison sentences is the best solution to reduce crime. On the contrary, some people say that there are better solutions to solve this problem. Overall, I totally agree with the latter opinion because I think that giving long prison sentences can not directly reduce crime.
Firstly, I observe the advantage about giving longer prison sentences. Surely, people may hesitate to commit crime by strict sentences. Even if they would commit crime, they would have to be in prison for long days. In addition, living in prison for a long time may give a time to reflect themselvs for them.
However, if crimers would be in the prison for a long time, it might be difficult for them to make them living on themselves because they might not be used to the social reality. It may cause them to commit crime again.
In addition to this, I think the poverty and a lot of burdens which people have may cause to commit crime. Because of two reasons, I think that countries have to propose policies which can stimulate economy and relieve their anxieties. Recently, many countries have experienced a recession. It cause the increasing the unemployment rate, so a lot of people suffer from hunger because of the povery. It will be supposed to cause them commit crime such as robbing. Then, people have many burdens because of woriking, raising their children and caring their parens. They have a lot of stress, so even if they could not reduce their stress, they might commit crime to reduce their mental pain. They may want a relax time.
I think the latter opinion is more valid than the former by these reasons. These are my opinion about this problem.",,,,,,6.0,"There are people who believe that the best way to reduce crime is to put criminals in prison for as long as possible. These people think that strict punishment will make people afraid to break the law. I agree that longer prison sentences can make people think twice before committing a crime, and it keeps dangerous people away from society. However, others argue that there are better ways to reduce crime, such as education and helping people find jobs. If people have more opportunities and are less desperate, they may not feel the need to commit crimes. Also, after being in prison for many years, it is hard for people to return to normal life, and they might break the law again. Therefore, I think just giving long prison sentences is not enough. The government should also focus on better education and improving the economy so that fewer people turn to crime in the first place. In my opinion, finding the reasons why people commit crime and helping them make better choices is more effective than only relying on long prison sentences."
875,2,Some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. Others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Nowadays, due to increasing of crime rate, some people tend to think of the best way to decline crime is giving a longer prison sentences. However, some criticisms probably believe that there should have much better ways to decrease crime. In my opinion, that is true to some extent for this statement. That means the prison sentences may be necessary, but I perfer the other ways such as education and detenion center rather than the prison sentences, especially for minors.
Firstly, it is possible to said that increasing the punishment would decline the crime in the society. Considering the fact that most of citizens afraid to lose their freedom as a longer time. Given the circumstance, Hong Kong goverment established a policy which force people to scan the QR code with the Leave Home Safe app for against the Covid-19, it was not very common initially without any punishment, yet after announcing the 10-year prison sentences amd 60-throusand-dollar fines, HongKongers use the app quite often now. So that probably means that the more punlishment they will get, the more attentive and cautious they will have.
On the other hand, it seem likely to have another proper ways to reduce the crimes . One example is creat a better and well-rounded education for people, particularly for youngsters. Some people could think of it is a more efficient way to develop and nurture thier manner for their whole life. For example, there are a lot of different kind of extra curriculums which consist of having a talk with polices and ICAC for students to join and teach them some form of concept to be a good citizen and take their responsibilities living in Hong Kong. Perhaps, it can show them some societal expectation rather than arresting them and destroy their future.
To summarize, there are different opinions for this statement. Even so, I believe that if we had spoon-feed information and set a better model for people, it will help people to reflect on their bad behaviour. Likewise, if goverment only established a lot of punishment for his residents consisently, they may feel stress out. It is probably not good for a long term development for a morden as well as international city and country.",,,,,,6.5,"There are different opinions about how to best reduce crime in society.

However, others believe that there are more effective solutions than simply locking people up for longer. They think that improving education, helping people find jobs, and giving support to those with problems like addiction or unstable family situations can prevent crimes before they happen. For instance, if young people have good role models and opportunities, they might be less likely to choose crime in the first place. In my opinion, while longer prison sentences may work in some cases, we should focus more on social programs and education to prevent crime, because this can solve the root causes and help people become better citizens in the long run."

However, some are divided and think that a number of better ways can help lessen the cases of crime. Which strategy should be taken to tackle this problem? This essay attempts to explore the view of both sides.
An increase in the rate of crimes is a raising concerns in the community. A longer prison sentence seems to be the straightforward method to impede the crimes caused. In fact, a continuous incarceration is no room for offenders to commit the crimes in the community. This seemingly becomes an immediate achievement in the short term period. Some people deeply believe the mindset of criminals can be eliminated by the deterrence effect of the longer sentences which deprive of a person's freedom in life. In addition, it is generally recognized that the offenders have to be punished in effect of their guilty acts. The outlaws deserve a lengthening prison term in which they repent their offenses resulting in a decline in the number of crimes.
Indeed, the incarceration can limit the offender's actions in a place at some points. However, it is not difficult to find there is a higher rate of reoffending upon release from prison across the countries. In 2013, the U.S.A. had a reoffending rate of 52% which prisoners reoffended within a year of release with a record of 49.2% in the U.K. The proportion of reoffenders occupied nearly a half of criminals. It reveals that the prison sentences is not a effective way to decrease the number of criminal cases. This implies that a decline in the crimes can be achieved araising from a decline in the likelihood of reoffending. Rehabilitation during the course of their sentence can be adopted to tackle this problems. These include direct therapeutic interventions to address the psychological causes of criminal behaviours as well as services to prepare offenderes to successfully reintegrate into the community after release. Those actions include the provision of academic programmes, vocational courses and employment opportunities.
My take on this is that the incarceration alone is rarely considered enough in the control of criminal cases. A longer prison term only increase the financial cost from the government, but it cannot lower the likelihood of criminal offenses. The governments have to address the root factors causing offenses is the prime issue to reduce the crimes.",,,,,,6.0,"There are differing opinions about how best to tackle growing crime rates, with some arguing that longer prison sentences are the most powerful way to deter criminals, while others believe alternative strategies are more effective. Supporters of extended imprisonment contend that harsh punishment discourages potential offenders and keeps dangerous individuals off the streets for longer periods, which could bring immediate relief to the public by reducing crime in the short term. They also maintain that strict penalties serve as a form of justice for victims and a warning to would-be criminals. On the other hand, critics highlight the high rates of repeat offenses among ex-prisoners, which suggests that imprisonment alone might not solve the underlying causes of crime. They argue that addressing issues like lack of education, unemployment, and poor mental health through targeted rehabilitation programs, skills training, and community support can have a more lasting impact. In my view, while longer prison sentences might temporarily restrain offenders, real progress in reducing crime likely comes from a combination of reasonable punishment and comprehensive efforts to help individuals reintegrate into society, thereby tackling the root causes of offending."

It reveals that the prison sentences is not a effective way to decrease the number of criminal cases. This implies that a decline in the crimes can be achieved araising from a decline in the likelihood of reoffending. Rehabilitation during the course of their sentence can be adopted to tackle this problems. These include direct therapeutic interventions to address the psychological causes of criminal behaviours as well as services to prepare offenderes to successfully reintegrate into the community after release. Those actions include the provision of academic programmes, vocational courses and employment opportunities.
My take on this is that the incarceration alone is rarely considered enough in the control of criminal cases. A longer prison term only increase the financial cost from the government, but it cannot lower the likelihood of criminal offenses. The governments have to address the root factors causing offenses is the prime issue to reduce the crimes.",,,,,,6.0,"The debate on how best to reduce crime in society remains widespread, with some asserting that lengthier prison sentences are most effective, while others propose alternative approaches for better results. Supporters of longer incarceration argue that harsher punishments deter potential offenders by instilling fear of severe consequences and that keeping criminals off the streets for longer periods ensures public safety. They contend that imprisonment provides direct control over offenders and serves as a strong warning against breaking the law. On the other hand, critics of this approach highlight that many prisoners reoffend after release, suggesting that extended sentences do not address underlying causes of criminal behavior such as poverty, lack of education, or mental health issues. These critics advocate for investment in prevention strategies, including community programs, education, and job training for at-risk individuals, arguing that rehabilitation and social support more effectively reduce crime rates over time. In my view, while keeping dangerous criminals away from society is sometimes necessary, relying only on longer sentences overlooks important solutions. Focusing on rehabilitation and addressing the social factors driving crime can create safer communities and offer individuals a genuine opportunity to change their lives for the better."
881,2,"Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Today, the advertising has become very powerfull thanks to the television and the internet. But is it true that it is now more important in terms of sail rates, than the goods themselves and the actual requests of the society?
First of all, I think that usually in the one selected price range, all the products serving the same purpose have more or less equal properties such as quality or taste. This is indeed true, for example, for many electronic devices which are are produced by the nearby factories somewhere in China regardless the brand, and therefore their sales depend more on marketing strategies.
However, if the one buys the goods of well known brand, he trusts the experience beneath this brand. This is a kind of assurance that a consumer gets excactly what he expects and that a product is not defective. For instance, when choosing the car, you probably would firstly consider BMW or Mercedec. The reason why you know them is not only good advertising, but also quality proved by millions of clients throughout the years.
Moreover, I believe that modern society actually moves towards the conscious consumption. This implies people becoming more and more awared of product and its manufactoring process ratheer than advertising. From that the decreasing of the aggressive marketing follows, though the marketing still has cruical role. In fact its focus changes so that it will become more informative and less disturbing in the future.
In conclusion I want to disclose my own point of view. I do agree with the topic to the certain extent, though I am sure advertising is only a one reason of high sales, among many others and its influence will decrease with time.",,,,,,7.0,"It is often claimed that the popularity of modern consumer goods is due mostly to advertising, rather than the true needs of society. While I acknowledge that advertising is indeed a powerful tool and influences many purchasing decisions, I do not fully agree that it outweighs genuine demand in every situation. For example, items like smartphones or bottled water are purchased not just because people see them on billboards but because they fill a practical need in daily life. On the other hand, many similar products are available, and consumers tend to choose the one they have heard about more often, which shows the effect of repeated exposure in advertisements. Nevertheless, there are also cases where advertising cannot save a bad product, as people will quickly stop buying it if it does not meet their expectations, no matter how flashy the commercial is. Furthermore, as people become more informed through reviews and social discussions on the internet, they often rely less on advertisements and make smarter decisions. In conclusion, while the role of advertising in high sales is significant and sometimes leads consumers to buy things they do not really need, real-life usefulness and quality are equally important factors that advertising alone cannot replace."
883,2,"Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There is no doubt that nowadays advertising plays a very strong role in saling goods. The high rate of sales does not always mean the real needs of some goods. In this essay, i will discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion.
In terms of advertising's power in increasing sales of popular consumer goods, advertising has an essencial role these days in sales. The main reason given to support this claim is advertisnig attracts people and inform people about the new and special products in a very special way. To illustrate, using social media for marketing and advertising raise sales dramatecly. People spend most of their times to watch what is in the social media and that means social media is the best way to do your marketing.
However, some people say that people buy these products not because they really need them but because they like the way that was used to advertise these products. On the other hand, some times people purchase goods because they have seen them or heard about them from others or from the social media not due to their needs of these products.
In conclusion, I believe that increasing the sales of some popular consumer goods show how strong is advertising and how advertising plays a crucial role in saling products. Also, smart business owners should think about advertising as a fast way to sale their goods. As was previously menthond, people can be attracted by all kinds of advertising and that definitly lead to increasing the sale rate.",,,,,,6.5,"It is often argued that the impressive sales figures of many popular consumer items today are largely due to the influence of advertising rather than actual necessity. Personally, I tend to agree with this viewpoint for several reasons. Firstly, advertisements are designed to create a desire for products by highlighting features that appeal to emotions or lifestyles, rather than actual needs. For example, many people are persuaded to buy the newest smartphone not because their old one is broken, but because the ads make them feel that owning the latest model will make them happier or more successful. Furthermore, the constant presence of advertising on television, social media, and the internet means that people are always being encouraged to buy more, often items they previously never considered. However, it is also true that some goods do fulfill real needs within society, such as food and medical supplies. In conclusion, while basic necessities are indeed driven by need, I strongly believe that the high sales of many popular products today mostly reflect the effectiveness and power of modern advertising rather than true necessity."
885,2,"Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Based on some alledges, publicity is the main reason for the high rate of selling not humans' requirements. Although in my point of view, commercials are impressive in realms that people are looking for to address their demands. However, some other factors are uttered here.
One of the most highlighted contributors has to do with the high quality of accepted brands among their rivals. To enlighten, some domestic brands that have been even supported by both public and similarly authorities never can compete with other abroad commodities, as, not only in the real of quality but in terms of price also they cannot attain any level among other imported things. As a vivid case, Japanese cars are utilized in the majority of countries, while other companies, such as American ones, have lost their attraction owing to their high rate of consumption of fossil fuels.
Furthermore, based on the alternations that have taken place in the world, like either the increasing population or the change of lifestyle, both the type and as well the number of substances that used to be utilized have undergone drastic shifts. For instance, individuals' usage of fast foods has skyrocketed in the last decade, due to the lack of time for cooking, hence the development of takeaways is eye-catching while the number of their customers has swelled sharply.
On the other hand, whereas advertising has been effective for some international firms, it would not be feasible if the improvement of transportation did not emerge. To illustrate, the main role is played by second-to-none commuting systems for delivering divergent products, therefore without their assistance, introducing goods to other parts of the universe seems to be meaningless while society does not have access to them as their choices.
To conclude, while publicity, nowadays, is exploited as a means for enhancing the chance of selling in different markets, to me, it is impossible to become prosperous if folks do not need those things. Nevertheless, other justifications that are associated with the appeal of various merchandise, namely their quality, should not be ignored.",,,,,,5.0,"There are those who claim that the overwhelming popularity of many consumer products can be best credited to the influence of advertising, rather than the actual needs of people in a community. While I agree that advertising holds significant sway in shaping purchasing choices and creating a sense of necessity, I believe the situation involves additional critical aspects. Firstly, it is undeniable that advertisements, particularly through social media and celebrity endorsements, can create desires for items that might not be essential, such as the newest smartphone models or branded athletic wear. However, it is equally important to consider people’s genuine requirements, which may coincide with the features promoted in popular goods. For example, technological advancement demands devices that enhance efficiency, and brands extensively promoted often fulfill such requirements due to their renowned reliability or innovation. Furthermore, consumer trends are influenced by cultural changes and evolving lifestyles, like the rapid adoption of smart home devices which not only reflects successful marketing but also meets the modern need for convenience. Beyond the power of advertising, factors such as product availability, after-sales service, and the overall reputation of brands play pivotal roles in high sales figures. In essence, while advertising undoubtedly amplifies demand and sometimes invents new expectations, I do not believe it alone determines what people buy; lasting, widespread popularity of consumer goods arises from a combination of effective promotion, genuine consumer needs, and the practical value these products provide."
887,2,The tendency of news reports in the media to focus more on problems and emergencies rather than on positive developments is harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole.To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In recent years, news reports on TV programs and news papers tend to focus on incidents and emergencies rather than positive developments. In Japan, because of this phenomenon, many people are influenced this country might be more dangerous than they thought. I disagree with these tendencies and should focus on more positive developments, including entertainment.
To go into detail, in Japan, once people turn on the TV in the morning. People face often face some news reports about a murder case, who were murdered, who is the criminal, and background details. In addition, there are more than 5 channels on TV, these all 5 channels broadcast the same incident at the same time. The Japanese government might take the control of media in order to agitate people to keep their attention on safety. It might be important to some extent, but it is not necessarily a good influence on people's mind if they were required to watch such a fierce, and negative incident every morning.
In contrast, when it comes Japanese crime rate, and case. They reached a peak of 2014, and keep decreasing until now. The cases are not significant derrence, compared with a few dacase ago. In addition, almost Japanese crimes tend to be petty crimes, such as thefts, frauds, shop lifting, and so on. In terms of the murder case, Japan is ranked as the 5th safest country among 160 countries in 2017. This means that the more media reported the savage crimes, people misunderstand Japanese society is getting more dangerous than a few decades ago.
Finally, it is understandable to report such a heavy incident to some extent. On the other hand, they should also report positive and attractive news, such as tourism, especially inbound sales figures has been increasing and contributing to Japanese economic growth, and some Japanese athletes have been successful in MLB(major league baseball), and football. This news must be more fascinating for Japanese people to encourage their own national identity.
In conclusion, this is not a black-and-white issue. But it might be more beneficial for people's minds to be positive. If some heavy incidents happened, the Japanese government should restrict TV companies to broadcasting only one channel, or limit the time shorter.",,,,,,6.5,"In modern society, the tendency of media to emphasize negative news, such as disasters and crimes, more than positive events greatly affects how individuals view the world and themselves. For example, in many countries, including Japan, people often start their day being bombarded by news about economic troubles, political scandals, or tragic accidents. This creates a perception that the world is unsafe and filled with problems, even though many positive developments are also happening every day. Personally, I believe this focus on negative news is harmful, as it increases anxiety and makes people overly cautious or even distrustful of others. Furthermore, when society continuously hears about dangers, they might lose hope in the possibility of positive change, ignoring achievements in technology, community efforts, or scientific discoveries that could inspire them. While it is important for the news to alert society about real risks, I think a more balanced approach, including good news, would support mental well-being and help people feel more optimistic about the future. Therefore, I agree that too much focus on negative issues in the media is damaging and a shift towards highlighting positive stories is necessary to create a healthier and more hopeful society."
889,2,The tendency of news reports in the media to focus more on problems and emergencies rather than on positive developments is harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole.To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"News reports in the media focus on problems and emergencies more often than on some positive events. Is it really harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole?
Let us consider the purpose of the media existence first. I suppose it is to spread important information, so that people may use it in their lives. And problems are usually more important than some positive developments, since, in fact, they are the things which people should be aware of in the first place. For example, due to the COVID, which is an international problem, many people lost their jobs. If they had been notified about the rising of pandemic though, they would have prepared somehow (save more money by cutting unnecessary expenses, learn a new profession and so forth).
Moreover, I believe problems shall be solved. And when people are concerned about some problems, they may tend to face them with honor and participate in solving them. For instance, the energy crisis is a huge problem, and it is important to aware society of it, so that individuals could try to be more careful with gas and electricity. In the end, society will benefit from it, so it is not harmful.
On the other hand, there is some negative impact of bad news on individuals sometimes. But I am sure it should be considered as psychological issues of particular individuals, rather than a problem of today's media system. People just should not fall in despair because of news reports, but think how they could take an advantage of the provided information to minimize a negative impact and help humanity to solve problems.
Finally, in my view, the stated tendency is not really harmful to society, but it may sometimes be harmful to the individuals, and they are responsible for it.",,,,,,8.5,"The tendency of the media to report more on problems and emergencies rather than positive news draws criticism for potentially harming individuals and society. However, I largely disagree with this view because the main function of news is to alert the public to urgent issues that require attention. For example, if the media had not focused so heavily on reporting wildfires in Australia, many residents would have been unaware of the danger and unprepared to evacuate. News about problems serves as a warning system and often encourages public debate and action, helping society address its biggest challenges. Of course, constant exposure to negative news may lead to feelings of anxiety in some people, but this problem can be managed by individuals learning to limit their news intake or seek balance. Additionally, problems and emergencies usually require collective knowledge and response, so highlighting them is beneficial for the common good. Positive developments are indeed valuable, but they often do not demand immediate changes in behavior. Therefore, I believe that while an excess of negative news can affect moods, the media’s focus on problems is generally not harmful and even helps drive societal progress."
891,2,The tendency of news reports in the media to focus more on problems and emergencies rather than on positive developments is harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole.To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"News reports seems all to have the tendency to have little interest on the positive developments and to be, by contrast, very focused on the issues emergencies. I argue, in agreement with some people, that this behaviur is extremely negative for both individuals and socienty in general.
The spred of news that are focused on the negative events are harmful to the individuals. Indeed, people who used to read newspapers or whatch the news on tv believe that all the things that happen in the world and should be recognised are negative. It follows that individuals are hopeless with respect to the era their are leaving and feel an intense regret. Despite their being interest in the problem of society, they will be persuated that nothing matter. The world, they believe, is almost ready for the distruction. People will feel not just the loss of hope but they will stop be propositive. For instance, when a person used to read everyday in the newspaper that the city in which he lives is corrupted and poor, he will feel that the place in which he lives just as dangerous and toxic. Instead, to present also a news, in the next page, in which is mention a positive news like that of a young citizien obtaining international recogniasement, then he will add to the negative emotions the hope. Hope is extremely central in our everyday phychological state.
The tendency of focusing on the negative happening also damage society. First of all, if all the citizien of a city feel bad because of the problems and emergency that characterise the city in which they live, then a big regret and fear will be shared by all the people and then all the society will lose active citizien that could have keep things better. Furthermore, a particular society in which the spread of negative news is overreacter will present itself as extremely risky. However, if the entire society (that of a country) is described just in negative terms, then the probability that people will try to go away from that country will be higher. This is for instance what is happenig in Italy. News reports everyday mention mafia, dissocupations and corruptions and the yougest are incliened to move away.
In conclusion, I believe that the consequence that derives from the spread of news that concern just problems and emergencies will affect individuals and siciety in a harmful way.

When people are continuously exposed to negative news stories, such as crimes, natural disasters, or scandals, they may begin to perceive the world as more dangerous and miserable than it actually is. This constant exposure can lead to increased anxiety and a lack of faith in humanity or the possibility of improvement. Many individuals, especially those who routinely follow the news, might feel powerless and discouraged to contribute to their communities, believing that nothing they do will truly make a difference. On a larger scale, this negative focus can harm society by weakening trust between citizens and also between people and their institutions. If only societal failures are shown, citizens may lose motivation to participate in civic life, and the sense of community can be destroyed. Moreover, consistently negative portrayals can fuel stereotypes and judgments about entire countries or groups, creating further divisions. If the media were to balance their coverage, highlighting positive stories and progress along with challenges, both individuals and society would be more optimistic, cooperative, and resilient. For these reasons, I am convinced that the current approach of prioritizing negative news leads to real harm for both people and the wider community."

For example, if every evening viewers only see stories about political failures and violence in their communities, they might start to believe that good things never happen or that improvement is impossible. This negative mindset does not just affect personal happiness; it also discourages civic engagement and hope for change. When people feel that problems are overwhelming and solutions are rare, they are less likely to participate in efforts to improve society or support positive initiatives. On a broader level, such reporting can create a collective climate of pessimism, making communities less trusting and more divided. While it is important for the news to address serious issues, it is equally vital to recognize progress and celebrate success so that individuals and societies remain motivated to strive for better. In summary, an overemphasis on negative news stories undermines both the well-being of individuals and the collective spirit of society."

This protects the person who is being accused of the crime.Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Our actions in Present time are product of the Past. It also concerns the Judge sphere. But sometimes laws and jury has no access to the information from defectant's background. Some peple - including lawyers - believe the accused person's past is very important. I completely argee with it and in this essay I will support my piont of view with some arguments.
Firstly, without knowing defectant's past, he could to throw everyone off the scent. Persons who are being accused of the crime usually try to soften their sentence. Tey are capable to lie about many things to avoid the prison.
Secondly, the defectant can have criminal record in past, so with having access to accused's background the point about this could help in researching the dicision of the case. For this part, is also possible to mention than criminal persons could intentionally go to the prison for some common case such as steeling somebody's property, to avoid of punishment of anything more serious and horrible like murdering or unlegal human trafickking. and in thhis moment the defectant's past is mostly important than ever!
Anothe reason why I agree with a jury should be given all the past facts are cases when the accused peron where slandered and because of missing few background details an innocent man might be convicted. In other words, in reason of unawarenes can interfere with judgement.
On the other hand, any personal problems cannot be presented as strong argument for acquittal of a crime.
In conclusion, having no access to the accused person's past facts is a big problem. Personally, I support the idea th change practice in a law and jury for them to should be given all the background information to prevent wrong researching their dicision about any case.",,,,,,5.0,"In my opinion, I disagree with the idea that a jury in a criminal case should be given all the information about the defendant’s past criminal record before they make their decision. This rule exists for a good reason, because everyone deserves a fair trial based only on the facts of the case they are being judged for. If juries knew about a person’s previous crimes, they might be quick to judge the person as guilty just because of their past, not because of the evidence in the new situation. For example, someone who was convicted for a small theft many years ago could be unfairly linked to a more serious case they are facing now, even if there is not enough proof. This could lead to more mistakes and innocent people being sent to prison just because of what happened in their past. In addition, people can change and learn from their mistakes, but if the jury always knows about their past, it will be much harder for them to get a second chance. On the other hand, some people argue that knowing a person’s record can help expose a pattern of criminal behaviour, but I think it is more important to focus only on the evidence related to the case at hand. Therefore, I believe that the law protecting the accused person from having their past record shown to the jury is fair and should not be changed."

Some law representatives claim that this should be reverted, and the jury must be provided with this information beforehand. I fully agree with this statement since the jury will have a better understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final decision will be easier to understand for the audience.
Having the jury the right access to the defendant's past criminal background, would provide the jury with enough information about the defendant's behaviour. This is because there are certain previous criminal behavioural patterns which allow a better profesional decision-making from the part of the jury. For example, a recent study of the Law's Practice of Melboune, has shown that around 77% of people who commit a crime, were involved in at least one criminal event in the past with similar characteristics to the current crime.
On the other hand, if the jury has access to the defendant's past criminal history, it would be easier for the audience to understand the nature of the jury's final decision. This is because there have been cases in which the jury's final decision was not completely accepted by the audience or misunderstood.

Although transparency is usually beneficial, I disagree with this suggestion because knowledge of previous offenses could encourage unfair judgements and endanger the principle of a fair trial. If jurors were presented with a defendant’s criminal history, there is a strong risk they would assume guilt based on patterns, rather than evaluating the case facts independently. For instance, if someone on trial for theft had past theft convictions, jurors might believe “once a thief, always a thief” and overlook evidence specific to the current case. This approach goes against the idea that everyone should be presumed innocent until proven guilty for their latest alleged act. Moreover, even a person with a criminal past is entitled to a fair consideration of each accusation. The danger of prejudice is so strong that most legal systems around the world keep such details separate until after a verdict is reached. Therefore, while giving the jury access to past records might seem to aid the search for truth, it would actually undermine basic legal rights by making it more likely for jurors to convict on reputation rather than hard evidence."

However, some legal professionals believe this policy should be reconsidered so that jurors have the full context when deciding on a case. I agree with this viewpoint because knowing the defendant's past can genuinely help a jury understand whether the current charge fits a pattern or is simply an isolated incident. For example, suppose a defendant is on trial for a string of burglaries, and it turns out they have committed similar crimes in the past. In that case, this information could be crucial for the jury to fairly evaluate the likelihood of guilt. On the other hand, it can be argued that such knowledge might bias the jury and make it difficult for someone to ever move past their criminal history, even if they are innocent this time. Nonetheless, if presented properly, a defendant’s criminal record could offer important insight, especially in cases where intention or habitual behavior are central to the crime. Ultimately, I believe the benefits of providing juries with relevant past records—in terms of enabling more informed and transparent verdicts—outweigh the potential disadvantages, as long as safeguards are in place to ensure the defendant is judged mainly on the facts of the current case."

Firstly, creating competitive work environment might encourage employees to work harder as they can get a reward such as money. However, exposing staff to this competitive situation frequently can weaken the unity of employees and cooperation with each other as a team. I believe that rewarding system for empolyees should be a yearly event to celebrate the end of the year.
Most of all, there are alternative ways to encourage staff to be more effective at work. Employers should plan a regular gathering for employees. For example, the company can organise sports events, dinner parties or tea breaks. This can help staff communicate each other as well as build a close relationship; which are neccessary for effective and creative work environment.
Overall, it is obvious that financial rewards can encourage employees work harder but frequent rewarding can weaken the unity of team at work place. In my opinion, the company should limit a reward system and find a wise solution to benefit employees' abilities by creating cooperative and positive work environment.",,,,,,6.5,"Rewarding employees with extra money for exceptional performance is a common management tactic that can have both positive and negative effects on a workplace. On one hand, financial incentives can motivate workers to put in extra effort and strive for outstanding results, which can boost productivity and company profits. However, if such rewards are given out too often or only to a select few, they may lead to rivalry and resentment among staff, undermining team spirit and cooperation. In my view, while occasional monetary bonuses have their place, companies should also focus on building a supportive and collaborative office culture. For instance, managers could recognize achievements through public praise, professional development opportunities, or flexible working conditions. These alternatives can encourage employees to work hard while also making them feel valued as part of a team. Therefore, a balanced approach combining different kinds of incentives will be far more effective in promoting long-term motivation and unity among staff members."

In general, employers should have a great vision about the future of their own company and how to improve it in a better way .
To start with, some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by simply giving them more many. In addition, that practice can act as a good source of motivation, you can see that your hard work and your extra hours wasn't waste after all .
On the other hand, this style of management may affect tha company and their community in a negative way . For example, the manager of the institution may be more focused on just one employee who's always have the extra credit for the work therefore the other employees work hard for nothing and that leave a bad idea that they clearly work for just having that extra money and rewards from the manager .
Beside that, employees will be affected and their productivity will change and drop even more and all of that is a result on how the management of a company impact their work and their effort of doing more .
To sum it up, all the members in that company worked so hard, a little credit for their effort and long hours of developing their company and rewards them for it won't do any harm . Not to mention, a manager can reward the staff of the institution by giving them a day or two off or basically a three hours break . Anything that make them really satisfied after their long and efficient work towards the developing of the company.",,,,,,7.0,"Rewarding employees with extra money for outstanding performance is a common management strategy, as it can encourage staff to put in more effort and feel recognized for their hard work. For many employees, financial rewards are a strong incentive that can boost morale and motivate them to keep excelling, knowing that their achievements lead to visible benefits. However, this system can also create unintended problems. For instance, when only a few individuals are regularly rewarded, others may feel left out or undervalued, regardless of their contribution. This can lead to jealousy or reduced teamwork, and eventually, some employees might not try as hard if they believe recognition is unfairly distributed. Instead of focusing mainly on monetary rewards, employers might find more balanced solutions for encouraging hard work. These can include regular feedback, opportunities for professional development, and non-monetary perks such as flexible hours or public acknowledgment of group achievements. In my experience, employees tend to feel more committed when they sense that the entire team is valued and their work environment is supportive. Therefore, while rewarding exceptional work with extra pay can be effective to some extent, combining this with other forms of appreciation could lead to a more positive and motivated workplace overall."

However, there are many different ways is which employers can implement to increase theit employees satisfaction in the work environment. In this essay, I will discuss why money incetives can be beneficial, and mention different alternatives.
Rewarding employees with money is one of the best ways to guarantee employees retantion and prevent employees tunrover. This is because most people work to provide better life for them and their families, and extra money can help them achieve that. As a result, companies can increase their employees satisfaction and encourage them turn off job offers. For example, yearly bounses are one of the main incentives to encourage people to work harder. However, companies who do not pay enough bounses can loss many special employees.
While money is considerd as one of the main reasons why employees are satisfied, it can add extra expenses on the companies, which can affect their future success. Managers can use different ways to encourage employees to work harder by saying thank you or giving them extra day off after a long project, which can have a positive effect on the work quality. For instance, in some private companies in Saudi Arabia, managers usually reward their staff by giving them day off when there is an important football match or when the weather is great.
In conclusion, while money incentives can reduce employees turnover, not all companies have the ability to implement this soultion. However, a much cheaper incentives can be used to achieve the same results.",,,,,,5.5,"Rewarding staff with extra money for their outstanding contributions can certainly increase motivation and performance in some workplaces. Financial rewards such as bonuses or pay raises show employees that their hard work is recognized, and can encourage them to stay committed to their roles. However, this approach does not work for everyone, and sometimes it creates an unhealthy competitive environment or feelings of unfairness among those who are not rewarded. For some employees, long-term job satisfaction is tied more closely to feeling valued by their managers and having opportunities for personal growth. While money can be an effective motivator, it is not the only way to encourage hard work. For example, some companies offer flexible work schedules, career development programs, or public recognition for achievements, all of which can boost morale and productivity. In my own experience, being thanked in front of the team made me feel just as appreciated as receiving a small bonus. Overall, while extra money can be effective in certain situations, employers should consider a mixture of both financial and non-financial rewards to motivate their staff and build a positive atmosphere at work."

In response to the fast-evolving business industry, white-colared people may need an extra motivation than just having their profile featured with a big company. To my firm believe, the practice of encouraging employess through incentives or bonus is an effective way of maintaining the quality of work as well as another way to show appreciation to the seniors.
To my knowledge, this stlyle of management has been practicing for more than a decade, from small to large enterprises. The development of target acheivement or goal getter tactic is no surprise. We cannot deny the fact that money plays the most important part of cycling the world's economic and, of course, our everyday life. Hence, the most effective and easiest way to get people' hand on work is no where around but an extra sum of incentives or bonus from the company's annual benefits.
This hit hard to my personal experience. I realised the essence of it when I worked in a telesale company. I was offered a relatively medium-to-low basic salary which could not even yeild me any allowance after living cost reduction. However, I was fortunate enough to have a monthly incentive which would be evaluated solely on my performance each month. The evaluation was fair to the extent that I feel appreciated for what I work for.
On the contrary, if there were not given any incentives and were offered with something else as a reward, i.g. a free trip to somewhere, a couple of coupon vouchers, or even a car or house, I would still be ungrateful compared with the extra money earned every month. The reason is simply because stable income is considered more reliable than any other tangible or intagible assets, in the perspective of an employee. On top of that, the incentives and bonus can be increased yearly or quaterly based on the company performance.
In summary, I would like to reiterate that I agree on rewarding the emplyees with incentives and bonuses. Due to the fact that they can be as tool to build a strong montivation among the employees and deliver the company's gratitude toward them in an appropriate way.",,,,,,5.0,"Rewarding employees with extra money for excellent work is a popular method used by many companies today. This approach, in my opinion, is quite effective in motivating workers since most people are, to some extent, driven by financial gain. From my own experience working in a retail store, I noticed that colleagues who received bonuses for reaching sales targets often worked harder and showed more enthusiasm. Nevertheless, this method can have certain drawbacks. For example, some staff members might feel left out or demoralized if they repeatedly fail to earn rewards, especially if their roles make it harder for them to stand out. This could result in tension or unhealthy competition among coworkers. In addition, not everyone is motivated by money alone; some workers value recognition, opportunities for new projects, or flexible working conditions just as much. Therefore, while financial bonuses are a strong incentive, I believe managers should also focus on other ways to encourage employees. For instance, praising staff publicly, offering personal development programs, or giving extra time off could make people feel appreciated and inspired. In summary, monetary rewards are helpful for motivating many employees, but the most successful companies combine them with other approaches that cater to a wider variety of needs and ambitions."

First of all, I strongly believe that when business practise recognised employers work with a financial reward the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of this action.

Therefore, while monetary rewards can drive some people to work harder, they might discourage others who feel overlooked or believe their contributions are not valued equally. In my experience, a mixed approach works best; for example, in a team I previously worked with, our manager not only gave performance bonuses but also provided opportunities for professional development and flexible work hours for everyone. These non-financial incentives, such as extra days off or public recognition, helped foster a more positive atmosphere and encouraged all staff members to contribute to the company’s goals.

913,2,"Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:In the past, sporting champions used to be motivated primarily by the desire to win a match or to break world records. These days they are more likely to be motivated by prize money and the opportunity to be famous.What message does this send to young people and how does this attitude to sport affect the sports themselves?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","There were many sport competitions organized after the World-War II since the first Olympic games was held in Athena, in 1963, to bring the world together again. Previously, sport competition was seen as an opportunity for the athletes to break the world records for the pride of their home countries. However, nowadays, people are more inclined to win the match because of money reward and glory. I believe that young people should be more encouraged to achieve their goals to become a champion so that the value of sport competition would not be purely for commercial purpose.
In the last decades, there have been a lot of sport competitions being held from national to global level. The athletes were trained by the supported teams to do their best to become the world champion. It was the pride of such athlete to win and see their national flags were rised after the match. Over the years, sport has become more commercial following its popularity to attract global audiences. Many athletes are paying more attention for the opportunity to win the match for commercial purpose. For example, one wants to become a famous soccer player so that they could become the ambassador of Adidas and get more income out of it.
Due to the temptation for getting famous and having more money, there are people who choose to play unfairly during a competition. Instead of focusing on increasing their skills, they would cheat to win the game for money. For example, a soccer player may use thyroid injection for boosting their energy level even though it is strictly prohibited. Moreover, sport is not seen anymore to promote peace and solidarity among people from different cultural backgrounds but for the chance to get the superficial gloriness.
To conclude, even if the motivation has shifted, the young people should learn to focus more on becoming a real champion and play fairly so that they can become the best athletes in thier expertise while the money and glory would follow them after.",,,,,,6.5,"It is clear that the motivation behind becoming a sporting champion has shifted significantly in recent years, moving away from the pure desire to break records or represent one’s country, and instead being driven by financial rewards and the pursuit of fame. This change sends a complicated message to young people, suggesting that personal gain is more important than passion, discipline, or fair competition. As a result, young athletes may start to see sports not as a way to build character or develop teamwork, but primarily as a means for making money or becoming celebrities. For example, many aspiring football players look up to stars not only for their skill, but also for their lucrative endorsement deals and high-profile lifestyles. This focus can sometimes encourage unhealthy competition, risk-taking, or even dishonest behavior, such as doping or unsportsmanlike conduct, in order to secure wins and attract sponsors. Additionally, the sports themselves may suffer as the spirit of fair play and mutual respect is overshadowed by commercial interests, making the games less about genuine achievement and more about entertainment value. Therefore, while it is not wrong to appreciate the opportunities that come with success, it is important for both young people and society as a whole to remember that the true value of sport lies in personal growth, respect for others, and striving to be one’s best, rather than simply chasing money or fame."
915,2,‘Failure is proof that the desire wasn’t strong enough’To what extent do you agree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Generally, in our real lives, failure and successful events usually are seen in workplaces, sports and in families. Actually i completely disagree that the act of failing is caused by a lack of desire and motivation. There are many different factors which influence our failure and success.
Firstly, the most recent event which affected significantly most of people's motivation, is the Covid-19 pandemic. The last two years there the number of business failure increased significantly due to lockdowns and victims by pandemic. For example the first lockdown in Europe happened in Italy in 2020, which restaurants, leisure facilities and shopping centres were obliged to close for more than one year. The consequence of this, was the loss of customers and the accumulation of debt, which led to many failures, because people had difficulties paying their bills and taxes.
On the other hand, failure could happen if people has no desire to expand their horizons. For example many developed companies that accept paying their employees larger amount of money, this action could cause laziness to company's members, even they could be absent from work. All that happens because of complacency. Consequently this can amount in dismissal and ruin their job's career and reputation in terms of work experience.
Taking all of this into account, failure it doesn't only depend on peoples' personality and behaviour, but is also caused by external factors, influencing dramatically people's lives in terms of profit.",,,,,,6.5,"In my opinion, the statement that failure is proof that the desire was not strong enough is an oversimplification of a much more complex issue. While a lack of motivation can certainly contribute to failure in various areas of life, there are often external circumstances or unavoidable challenges that can cause even the most devoted individuals to fall short. For instance, I remember a friend in university who worked extremely hard to pass a certain difficult exam, studying for weeks and sacrificing sleep, yet still failed due to the unexpected difficulty of the questions and poor health on the test day. Similarly, in the world of sports, athletes can have immense passion and determination, but injuries or unfair referee decisions can prevent them from achieving their goals. Additionally, economic conditions, technological changes, and other factors beyond one’s control can play a huge role in the outcome of one’s efforts. While strong desire increases the likelihood of success because it drives persistence and hard work, it does not guarantee a positive result. Therefore, I believe failure cannot simply be blamed on a lack of desire, since many other elements influence our ability to succeed."
917,2,‘Failure is proof that the desire wasn’t strong enough’To what extent do you agree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Failure is what nobody wish for, but it could occur secondarily to an unsuccessful attempt towards ones goal, for various reasons. I am in the view that, failure is not a proof of lack of desire, rather it is more to do with improper techniques, less allocation of time and lack of proper attitude.
It is the general view that, ultimate success in any field is taught through the failures in life. One can be subjected to multiple failures due to lack of ability to develop essential skill set, also known as techniques, that would be essential to achieve a certain goal. One classic example is Thomas Alwa Eddison, the great inventor of all time, who went through nearly 100 unsucessfull experiments, before inventing the light bulb. He was brave enough to accept the failure experiments had taught him 100 different impossible ways not to discover the light bulb.
On the other hand, time plays one of the most crucial factors in obtaining a goal/success. By this I meant, the time that is allocated towards full filling tasks that are directed towards preparing for the goal. The little time is spent during the preparation, the further away the goal felt like. For an instance, one cannot expected to win a marothon with just one day preparation.Similarly, attitude plays by far the most striking part of the success. This is simple as, one cannot dream of becoming a good physician, having shown no interest in paying attention to people and their health related complaints.
In a nut shell, failure is not a proof for inadequate desire in fact, failure is due to improper practices of techniques,failure of managing time in preparing and attitudes that fires the drive.",,,,,,7.0,"Failure is often seen as evidence of insufficient desire, but I do not fully agree with this viewpoint. While motivation is important in reaching any goal, there are many other factors that contribute to success or failure. For example, someone may be extremely passionate about passing an important exam, but if he or she lacks proper study strategies or does not have access to good resources, failure may still occur despite strong desire. Additionally, external circumstances, such as financial hardships or family emergencies, can make it difficult for even the most determined person to succeed. I know a friend who was deeply devoted to becoming a professional athlete, dedicating much of his time and energy to training, but unfortunately sustained a serious injury that prevented him from achieving his ambition. This shows that personal desire alone is not always enough; skill development, opportunity, and sometimes even luck play major roles in the outcome. In conclusion, I believe failure is not a sure sign of weak desire; rather, it is often the result of a combination of factors that extend beyond just wanting something strongly."
919,2,"To be labelled a ‘Work of Art’, a painting, sculpture or other art form should display certain qualities that are unique. However, over the past century there has been a decline in the quality of prize-winning artwork and it is now possible for quite ordinary pieces of art to be labelled ‘masterpieces ’ whilst true works of art pass unnoticed.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","For centuries, artworks have been titled  'Work of Art' based on their extraordinary qualities. However, some people argue that nowadays, the standards are decreasing and the labelling of substandard artworks as 'masterpieces' has become ubiquitous. The upcoming essay will discuss why I agree that original paintings are being neglected while usual ones are being praised.
Firstly, the superficial nature of humans is responsible for this change. These days, people do not see the meaning behind the painting or the message the artist is trying to convey rather they buy those paintings which are popular and contemporary. To illustrate it further, in art auctions it can be seen that when one person bids on one painting, no matter whether it is good or bad, others also start putting their money on it. Thus it is clear that normal art forms are winning prizes due to public attention.
Secondly, some artists might bribe the organizers of exhibitions to promote their canvas. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances when artists were caught while signing up deals to increase the sales of their work. If a certain artwork receives publicity then it is impossible that it would not have an influence on the public. This type of promotion skews a person's opinion about a certain picture and so are forced to think about purchasing it, leaving behind original ones. Therefore, it is apparent that the diabolical activities of painters are responsible for their works being labelled as masterpieces.
To conclude, the maintenance of social position and influence of painters are the prime causes for the popularity of ordinary artworks and the negligence of true works. Hence I agree with the given statement.",,,,,,8.0,"In recent times, the definition of a 'Work of Art' appears to have shifted, leading to a situation where ordinary or even mediocre pieces are celebrated, while more deserving creations often remain in obscurity. I personally agree with the view that the quality of prize-winning art has declined and truly innovative pieces are frequently overlooked. One key reason is that art competitions and galleries tend to chase trends or prioritize shock value rather than genuine skill or originality. For example, abstract or minimalist artworks—which may not require much technical ability—often win major awards simply because they are fashionable or provocative. Furthermore, social media has influenced public taste, with viral pieces sometimes gaining fame for reasons unrelated to their artistic merit. In my own experience visiting art exhibitions, I have noticed that artworks receiving the most attention are often those accompanied by clever marketing or catchy descriptions, while intricately crafted but less flashy works go largely ignored. Therefore, I believe that the art world’s current emphasis on novelty and popularity has led to the undervaluation of true masterpieces in favor of works that are merely trendy or well-promoted."

Ask anyone who the fastest man on the planet is and anyone will mention ""Usain Bolt"". This is probably not wrong. However, Is it possible that a young man in a remote village in East Africa, who has never seen a car in his life and has been racing horses his whole life, could actually be faster than Usain Bolt? I believe so. The only issue is that Usain Bolt had a platform. In the same way there is probably some artistic genius somewhere, who doesn't have access to a plush gallery, who is creating breath-taking artwork. But alas, who is there to judge the mastery of his piece?
Works of art were probably easier identified in the past because there were so few great artists. Today we are drowning in them. It makes it hard to sift through the ordinary and the divine; diamonds in the rough. It appears that those who are heard are those who scream the loudest. That is why something as simple as a black circle drawn on a plain white canvas would be valued above a portrait of my grandmother painted with branches for brushes and ash and coal for paint.
Social media has come to give a voice to the voiceless and an opportunity to show the world true art in the most unlikely of places. But again, I ask, ""Who is the ultimate judge of what should be called a masterpiece?"" Until the right eyes see the work of these geniuses, royal hallways will continue to be lined by framed palm-prints.
Great art is not obsolete. Great art only needs a platform and a spotlight.",,,,,,6.5,"The question of what is truly a ‘Work of Art’ is as old as art itself, and I tend to agree that many remarkable creations remain overshadowed while some quite ordinary pieces are celebrated as masterpieces today. In the past, the standards for great art seemed clearer—innovation, technical mastery, and emotional depth. Nowadays, however, I have noticed from my own visits to galleries and following major art competitions, that what wins awards often feels driven more by novelty or shock-value than by skill or originality. For example, I have seen installations that consist of everyday objects merely rearranged in a gallery and labeled as groundbreaking, while painstakingly detailed paintings by lesser-known artists hang unnoticed in the corner. This tendency is perhaps worsened by social trends and influential critics who shape public opinion. It is not that true artistic talent has declined; on the contrary, I believe it may be more widespread than ever. The problem, it seems, is that the voices recognizing and uplifting artistic excellence are often drowned out by hype and trends. Ultimately, I think a true masterpiece transcends time and fashion, and it is up to each generation to look beyond the noise and rediscover the works that genuinely move, challenge, and inspire us."
923,2,"Write about the following topic.The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In the past decades, there was a rapid increase in the use of road traffic in cities over the world as cities sprawl where cars become essential while transit, bicycling and walking become less practical. Commuting from home to work, shopping and going to school from place to place account for a higher sheer volume of traffic in the cities that is causing a thousand hundreds of problems, consisting of traffic jams and air pollution. Some people believe there is an enormous improvement in road traffic if the travelling needs for people across the cities are deducted. The governments play a vital role to figure out this issues.
There is no doubt that cities have spread out over larger expanses of land as builders have construced wide expressways and ample parking to accomodate motor vehicles. This tempts a large surge in car use and public transit use has fallen. A case in point is Los Angeles where traffic jams are a part of living. According to a survey in 2016, Los Angeles drivers spent an average of 104 peak drive-time hours fighting slow traffic. Michael G McNally, a professor at the University of California claimed that the poor public transit services was one key of factors in the congestion incident on the road of Los Angeles. This forces people to drive their cars to travel from place to place as there is no option to be chosen.
However, improving public transport facilities alone is rarely considered enough to cope with the high volume in usage of the road traffic as the demand is still there. In recent years, the number of suburban hypermarkets ballooned in the cities, particularly in the developed countries, due to the high land cost in metropoils. Thereby, the amount of road traffic is sharply escalated in cities since people can drive their cars from home town to suburban or their destination. LA had an estimated 7.8 million registrations in population of 10 million in 2016 when New york just had 3.6 million registrations in population of 8.5 million. Car owners accounted for nearly 80% of population in L.A. This is highly likely that the car ownership is an vital reason for the busy road traffic. Reduction in numbers of car ownership is definitly one solution in the traffic congestion. By adopting policies to increase the car registration fee and to rise the parking cost, government can take one important step towards solving this problems.
My own view is that the travelling needs from place to place continuously increase in line with the development of metropolis. The high cost of parking and car registration fee combined with the 24-hour public transit system in cities can effectively limit the number of car ownership. This is a direct impact on the volume of road traffic over the cities.",,,,,,7.0,"While it is true that reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education, or shopping could have a positive effect on city traffic, I do not think this is the only solution or even the most practical one in many cases. Many people prefer to attend school in person or shop at physical stores for the experience or immediate access to goods and services, and likewise, some jobs simply cannot be done remotely. For example, in my city, many workers in healthcare, manufacturing, and hospitality must physically travel to their workplaces every day. Even with the growth of remote work and online shopping, traffic congestion has not eased as expected, because people still travel for leisure, errands, and socializing. Additionally, public transportation systems could be improved to accommodate more commuters comfortably and efficiently, which would likely encourage more people to leave their cars at home. Policies promoting cycling, carpooling, and pedestrian-friendly city planning can also help alleviate congestion. In conclusion, while minimizing travel needs may contribute to reducing traffic, a combination of strategies such as enhancing public transport, encouraging alternative transport methods, and thoughtful urban design is essential for managing urban traffic effectively."

Finding solutions to reduce traffic is very crucial. I totally agree that if people travel less from home to work or to education or even for shopping can reduce the amount of traffic. With the covid 19 outbreak pandemic we saw how much the working from home and using the zoom application for studying reduced the traffic in cities. People now are using online for shopping too. We know that traffic can be reduced if less consumers are using the roads. However, I dont agree that this is the only way to reduce traffic. Other strategies to reduce traffic are :
1. Planning the roads and building the road bridges in a smarter way with special lanes for public transportation.
2. Encourging people to use light trails, public transportations and to use car pools.
3. Building special lanes for motorcycles and electric bikes.
4. The governoment can put more regulations regarding how many cars each family can have.
5. Increasing the vehicles prices and reduce the public transportation tickets.
6. Educate people on the consequences of traffic and how it can inadverntly affect their life.
7. Encourge people to walk more and to choose a work that is close to your home.
As I mentioned above there are many strategies that can help in reducing tranffic and only by reducing the need for people to travel from home.

While it is true that encouraging people to work, study, or shop from home can help cut down the number of cars on the road, I do not think this is the only solution available. During the pandemic, we all noticed that roads became much clearer when many people worked and attended school online, so this clearly proves that reducing travel can reduce traffic. However, city traffic is a complex problem that needs different approaches. For example, if governments invest more in public transport systems and make buses, trains, and subways more convenient and affordable, more people might leave their cars at home. Also, creating bike lanes and pedestrian areas can encourage people to use healthier ways to get around. On top of that, cities could introduce carpool programs or restrict cars in certain busy areas at peak hours. Although making it so people do not have to travel for work, school, or shopping does help, combining this with better transport options, city planning, and public awareness campaigns would be a much more effective way to reduce city traffic for everyone."

Additionally, improving public transport systems and establishing safe biking paths give people real alternatives to driving, which also plays a huge role in reducing city traffic. In the city where I live, the introduction of a reliable metro system and the popularity of shared bikes helped many people leave their cars at home, cutting down on daily gridlocks.

In my own experience, especially after the global pandemic, many companies have shifted towards remote work and online education, leading to noticeably fewer cars on the road during rush hours. Online shopping has also become much more common, as people prefer to make purchases from the comfort of their homes. However, simply encouraging everyone to stay home is not realistic for all jobs and activities, and there are other effective ways to manage traffic. For instance, improving public transport can encourage people to leave their cars behind, as I have seen in my city where a new metro line reduced congestion during peak times. Additionally, creating more bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly paths, as well as promoting carpooling, can help further limit the number of vehicles on the streets. Therefore, while staying home for work or education is a helpful tool, cities should also focus on developing better infrastructure and alternative transport options if they want to truly solve traffic issues."

As a results any major city in the world is experiencing very dense traffic.This trend is now also being noticed in smaller cities too.
In order to reduce the amount of traffic, people should reduce their travel to work, education and shopping. At work that could mean working from home whenever it is possible, limitate the domestic and international business trip when not absolutely needed. Online studying could be generalized when the fied of study does not requires physical practice nor specific facilities. Since online shopping is becoming trendy we could change our habits and go on the web rather than in malls or in town in order to shop. The movement restrictions imposed during the covid-19, especially during the lockdown demonstrated that this is possible. However, during that period, most of us realized that this lack of mobility and travel freedom is not the best and is a heavy constraint, both personal and profesional.
Shouldn't we look for other alternatives in order to reduce the traffic ?
It is now well known buy all that using the public transportations is a great way to reduce the traffic. It is usually faster than using a private car and it is more eco-friendly. Even if it also has disadvantages such as the lack of timetable flexibilty, the lack of privacy, sometimes the price... it should be our prefered way of transportation whenever possible.
Carpooling is another great way to reduce traffic. Wether it is for daily trips to work or week-end escapades, that is a great way to contribute to a limitate the numbers of vehicules on the road. Maybie governments should find incitative measures such as the one on some U.S highways, where carpools have access to express lanes while the private drivers who are alone in their cars have more restrictions.
Even if our society is evoluting towards a very internet connected world where you can work, study and shop remotely, I think people might limitate their movement but won't stop travelling, whether it is long or short distance.
Instead of keeping selling millions ( or maybie trillions of cars every year on earth ) government as well as individuals should rather rethink the way they move and transport themselves.",,,,,,6.0,"It is often argued that the most effective way to reduce traffic in modern cities is by minimizing the necessity for individuals to leave their homes for work, education, or shopping. While I recognize that encouraging remote work, online learning, and digital shopping can indeed contribute significantly to lowering traffic, I believe this is not the only solution and perhaps not the most sustainable one. For example, during the pandemic, many people worked and learned from home, resulting in much less congestion, yet most individuals found this lifestyle isolating and missed the social benefits of traveling outside. Furthermore, not all professions or educational fields are suitable for remote formats, as some require physical presence and hands-on experiences. Instead, encouraging the use of efficient public transportation systems, promoting cycling and walking, and investing in better infrastructure could also drastically cut down traffic problems. Cities could also implement policies like carpooling incentives or congestion charges to discourage the unnecessary use of private vehicles. Ultimately, while reducing the need to travel is one possible approach, a combination of measures adapting both technology and urban planning would likely offer the most comprehensive and long-lasting solution to urban traffic woes."
933,2,Write about the following topic.Young people in the modern world seem to have more power and influence than any previous young generation.Why is this the case?What impact does this have on the relationship between old and young people?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In modern times, the younger generation appear to be more powerful and influencial compared to the generations in times past. I believe this is as a result of younger people being more ascertive, stepping up to question and change existing societal norms and archaic cultures. At first, this may negatively affect their relationship with the older generation as a result of how unfamiliar they are to these changes but subsequently, the tension is bound to resolve, when the older generations come to accept these changes.
To begin with, it is an open truth that young people these days tend to be very bold and outspoken and unlike their predecessors, are better at questioning norms that do not sit right with them and even going an extra mile to change these norms or cultures. A good example of this is seen in women empowerment and rights activism. In my part of the world, some years back, it was believed that a woman's place is in the kitchen and her sole job was to birth and rear children, therefore, women were not allowed to be educated or have paying jobs. Women in the older generation complied to this because it was the norm, but this is not the case in modern times, because many young women opposed to it and now, homes are even headed by women; the power of activism.
Many people in the older generation are not familiar with young people being more outspoken and this is understandable because in their time, they were taught to only follow rules and not to question them. Therefore the fact that young people have become more outspoken and powerful is foreign to them and just like every human nature, whatever is foreign or different is automatically hated. As a result, there is likely going to be a tension between the 2 generations, however, with constant advocation and learning the tension is bound to resolve. For example, going back to women's rights activism, at the start, many older people were not on board as they did not think it was normal, however, there are now a lot of older people who have become activists.
In conclusion, I believe that the power and influence the younger generation has is as a result of their ascertiveness and will to effect changes in their societies and even though it may cause a negative relationship with the older generation at first, subsequently, their differences is likely to be ironed out when the older generation learns to accept these changes.",,,,,,6.0,"In today's world, it is evident that young people possess a greater degree of power and influence compared to previous generations. This shift can largely be attributed to the rapid advancement of technology and increased access to global information, which allows young individuals to connect, share ideas, and organize movements with unprecedented speed. Social media platforms, for instance, have become powerful tools for the youth to express their views and mobilize support for changes they wish to see in society. As a result, young people have played critical roles in bringing attention to issues such as climate change and social justice, which were previously overlooked or suppressed. However, this newfound influence has sometimes led to a strained relationship between the old and young. Older generations may feel threatened or left behind by these changes, leading to misunderstandings and conflicts. For example, in my community, many older adults initially resisted new environmental initiatives led by youth, considering them unrealistic. Still, over time, some have come to see the value in listening to younger voices. In summary, the empowerment of young people is fueled mainly by technology and their willingness to challenge traditional norms, which at first can cause friction with older generations, but ultimately has the potential to foster greater understanding and progress if both groups remain open to dialogue."

This is due to the mastery of using technology which overtake old people positions in many areas.
The young people in this era are able to take more advantages of using technology compared to the old generation, providing opportunities for innovation in an unconventional way and to increase income. For example, in the past, people were more engaged to TV programs and become passive consumers. However, because of the existance of YouTube, many young people can actively and creatively making contents such as cooking, music, or motivational videos and making it as a source of income. A YouTouber who have subscribers over than 30 million people such as Atta Hallilintar, for instance, has approximately more than 50.000 Euro income per month only by inviting people to watch his videos. Furthermore, by becoming a famous YouTuber, the person has a sigfinicant role as an influencer by showing his lifestyle, values, and even political views. He can also create new businesses such as food or clothing business, and it is easy to get into the market as followers will tend to be happily purchase items from their YouTube idol.
Due to the advancement on technology, many old people have difficulties of following such trend and thus, they are easily left behind. Many of them are still working on their conventional way by not taking benefit of technology. For example, an old man who has a clothing store cannot use social media for marketing his business resulting to only attract local people to buy his items. This issue has limited the old generation to compete with the young people in terms of source of income.
To conclude, the young people have more control and ability to influence the global economic progression by replacing the conventional ways from the old generation and resulting them having less important positions in a global competition.",,,,,,7.0,"Today, young people hold considerable power and influence because they have grown up surrounded by advanced technology and social media. Unlike previous generations, today’s youth are “digital natives” and can easily access information, communicate instantly with others around the world, and use platforms like Instagram, TikTok, or Twitter to share their opinions. This accessibility allows them to build large online communities and quickly spread ideas or trends, often leading to significant social or even political change. For instance, young activists have used online petitions and viral posts to draw attention to climate change and social justice, which has put pressure on leaders to make decisions with young people’s opinions in mind. However, this shift in power can sometimes create tension between generations. Older people may feel their traditional knowledge or experience is being ignored, and they might struggle to keep up with the newest tech or social trends. In families or workplaces, this can lead to misunderstandings, with older people seeing young people as too impatient for change and young people viewing elders as outdated. Still, when both sides are open to learning from each other, these generational differences can also lead to productive collaborations and a better understanding across age groups. In summary, the technological skills and global reach of modern youth have given them more influence than ever before, which reshapes their relationships with older generations in both positive and challenging ways."

But it seems that it is changing in our modern world, young people now really have their word to say, are being heard and are influencing the whole society.
Internet and generalised use of social media has had a huge impact on how people communicate, especially for the young generation. While our generation grew up without acces to internet, asking for informations to our parents, teachers... young people have access to all kind of knowledge and datas on the web. They can forge their own opinions easily and expose their ideas to the entire world throught internet. Then they can share these ideas and discuss with people from everywhere in the community or in the world , their point of view are taken into account because their voices are being heard widely through internet.
Multinationals and marketing companies well understood that the young generation is the one giving the trend. They use all the data collected from the social networks to target the product that the youngest one are going to plebiscit. This underlines the fact that the taste and ideas of the young people are powerful and really are influencing the whole society in a large spectrum.
Sometimes, this is hard to accept for the oldest one who have been raised with a very diferent approach. In many countries, for a very long time, the oldest people, known as the one with the knowledge, were the one deciding, taking the decisions and showing the way. They were representing the authority and the power that very often young people would follow without questionning about the fact that things evolve and could be done in a very diferent way.
However, we can learn a lot from the young generations. As they were born in world changing faster and faster they often are more resilient than we are and they probably fit better in that new modern world where adaptibility is a key to success. It makes them extremely powerful and influent, wether it is at work or at home.",,,,,,7.0,"In today's rapidly evolving world, it is clear that young people have gained more influence and power than any younger generation in history. One important reason for this shift is the widespread access to technology and the internet, which allows young people to connect, communicate, and share ideas on a global scale. Unlike in the past, when older generations were the main source of knowledge and guidance, now young people can instantly find information and present their opinions through social media platforms. As a result, they are not only shaping popular culture and changing trends, but they are also becoming important voices in political and environmental movements, as we have seen with youth-led protests about climate change or social justice. This increase in influence can sometimes cause tension between the generations, because older people may feel left behind or challenged by the speed at which young people adapt and innovate. However, it can also create opportunities for learning and collaboration. When older and younger generations work together, combining experience with fresh perspectives, society as a whole can progress more effectively. In my own experience, I have seen how young people in my community were able to organize events and create online campaigns that gained attention even from older citizens who might usually ignore youth opinions. In conclusion, the empowerment of young people is mostly due to technology and global communication, and while it can affect relationships between the ages, it also holds great promise for future cooperation and positive change."

While its benefial effects is acknowledged, some people still believe that it has a negative influence on people and societies. In my opinion, the benefits of music to both individuals and societies outweighs its detremental effects. In this essay, however, I will discuss both points of views.
To start with, the fact that some people consider music a bad influcence is understandable especially when considering idolisation of musicians among young people. For example, the effect that the current world wide sensation Korean boy band, BTS, have on a lot of young people is unexplanable. Many youngsters have idolised this group to the extent where it affects their education and life in general. Definately, parents of children affected by this group will not be happy with their activities and will therefore develop negative feelings towards them. Furthermore, as many more young people lose focus because of their love for music and musicians, the society suffers in the long run because these people are less likely to be productive members of the society.
Moving on, music also has a number of positive effects on people and societies. The first being that it is actually a lucrative source of livelihood for those involved and It also creats job opportunities. To explain further, musicians do not work alone, they need to be managed, they need a stylist, a make-up artist, song writers, graphic designers, to name a few and all these positions create an opportunity for young people to fill them. Furthermore, music is a good way to relax and calm one's mind. This method is even employed in therapy to aide the treatment or management of some anxiety disorders. Lastly, considering its effect on societies, the contribution of the music industry to a nations economy cannot be overlooked. Its contribution has always been tremendous and many times, important political figures have awarded musicians that have played a huge role in not only the economy of the country but her public image as well. For instance, very recently, the president of South Korea awarded BTS for their contribution, through their music, to the growth and international recognition of the country.
In conclusion, despite the controversy, in my opinion, the effect of music has more pros than cons on both individuals and societies because the industry not only creates job opportunities, music can also be used for the management of some mental health disorders and finally, it contributes a lot to a country's economy.",,,,,,6.0,"Music is a central part of human experience, playing a role in every society and culture around the world, but opinions differ as to whether its influence is mostly positive or negative. On one hand, music is celebrated for its ability to bring people together, promote emotional expression, and inspire creativity. For instance, songs sung at community events or national anthems at sports matches foster unity and patriotism, while listening to music at home can help individuals deal with stress or sadness. Furthermore, the music industry offers countless employment opportunities, not only to performers but also to producers, technicians, and event organizers, thereby helping the economy and society at large. On the other hand, some people worry that certain types of music can encourage undesirable behaviors or distract young people from their studies and responsibilities. For example, some critics claim that music with explicit lyrics might encourage bad behavior among teenagers, or that fans of famous artists may become obsessed and neglect other aspects of life. In my view, while there are possible risks associated with music, these are greatly outweighed by its advantages. The positive effects, such as fostering social bonds and providing healthy outlets for emotion, are far more significant than the potential downsides, which can often be prevented through proper guidance and awareness. In summary, music is generally a force for good in both individuals’ lives and within society, but it is important to recognize its influence and encourage its positive use."

second of all when a person get older his brain is more likly going to get weaker there for it will be harder for them to functaion also there memory will get weaker too in that stuation that will make work extra harder for them there for it would not make the working enviroment fear for people at all, for example ueasly for evrey one who work in the same job will get paid the same amount but that would not be fear for older people becuase they put more efert to there work.
inconclusion i feel that having an age restriction for jobs is hugly important in different ways like working qulity and people's health.",,,,,,5.0,"Many people believe that since people are now living longer, the retirement age should be increased a lot, but I do not fully agree with this idea. In my opinion, although life expectancy has gone up, this does not always mean people are able to work effectively for more years. First, as people age, their physical abilities often decline. Even if someone is healthy, tasks that require standing for long periods, increased concentration, or lifting heavy things can become very challenging. For example, an older nurse or construction worker may struggle to keep up with the physical demands of their job, which could put them at risk for injuries. Second, staying longer in the workforce could make it harder for young people to find jobs. If older people keep working, there may not be enough job openings for younger generations who are just starting their careers. Finally, after working many years, people deserve to rest and enjoy time with family or travel, which would not be possible if they had to work much longer. In conclusion, I think the retirement age should stay as it is so people can retire while they are still healthy and let younger workers have more opportunities."
947,2,"Some say that because many people are living much longer, the age at which people retire from work should be raised considerably.To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued by some people that because nowadays people live longer than they used to, retirment age should be raised. In my opinion, I think that companies should use other measures to determine the right time for retirment.
In recent years, many companies have set rules for retirment age. This is because these companies believe that when people reach a certain age they do not performe as good as younger employees. As a result, many experianced employees lose their jobs, which can affect both employees and companies. For example, some companies require experianced employees to retire at the age of 60, which can lead to loss of valuable knowlege that can be used to train younger employees. To solve this problem, companies can use different measure to help them decide when to ask their emplpyees to retair or resign.
On the other hand, I believe that companies should focus on their employees performance and work quality, rather than their ages. The reason for this is that companies should retain well performing employees, which has nothing to do with age. For instance, companies can monitore their employees work quality as a way to meaure their ability to continue working. As a consequence, companies would have a stronger performance compared to other companies who use age as a measure, this is because they will have experianced and well performaing employees at the same time.
In conclusion, while companies uses ages to measure when it is the right time to retire, I believe that other measures such as performance and work quality should be used.",,,,,,6.0,"Some people believe that since life expectancy has increased, people should work for more years before retiring. However, I disagree with the idea that the retirement age should be raised for everyone simply because people are living longer. It is true that older adults may be healthier nowadays and able to work past traditional retirement ages, but there are many factors to consider. For instance, certain jobs require a lot of physical effort or high concentration, and employees may struggle to perform well as they grow older. For example, a construction worker or a nurse may experience difficulties doing their job effectively in their late sixties. Moreover, not everyone wants or needs to keep working into old age, and everyone’s personal situation is different. Instead of increasing the retirement age for all workers, I believe it is better to offer people the choice to retire when they feel ready or to continue if they are willing and able. In this way, both companies and their employees can benefit from more flexibility rather than creating a strict rule for everyone."
949,2,"Some say that because many people are living much longer, the age at which people retire from work should be raised considerably.To what extent do you agree or disagree?","People nowadays are living much longer.
With the discovering of new medicine and with the innovation in the medical field, the life expectancy of a person skyrocketed over the last decade.
Some people might think that the consequence of this phenomenon should be the fact that the age at which people retire from work ought to be raised considerably.
I don't agree with this idea.
Rather than involving the life expectancy of a person, we should consider the job itself.
Is it tiring? Does it require a person to be able to react immediately to a potential problem?
If the job is tiring I think that it would be better for a person to retire. If you end up being worn out every day because your job is very exhausting the life expectancy should not be the fact that decides if you have or not the right to retire.
The question ought to be: Is the person physically and mentally able to cope with the work?
The older you get the slower you become. This is another pivotal factor that should be taken into account when deciding the retirement age of a person.
The ability to react to dangerous events keeps the working environment under control.
Let's imagine a carpenter working on the construction of a new building.
What if a wall suddenly falls? Does an elderly person react faster than a younger worker?
I am an optimistic person but I would stick to my guns in this scenario betting on the younger person.
I would like to wrap up this essay by saying that I could have thought of many more reasons that explain why the age at which people retire from work should not be based entirely on the fact that people are living longer.
Of course, this can not be ignored but basing this decision only on this fact it is seen by me as a poor approach.",,,,,,5.0,"It is true that average life spans are increasing in many countries today due to advances in healthcare and improved living conditions. Some people argue that because people are living longer, they should also work for more years before retiring. However, I believe this is not necessarily the right solution. The ability to continue working until a later age depends not just on longevity but on health, job type, and personal circumstances. For example, someone who has a physically demanding job may not be able to perform well into their late sixties or seventies, regardless of life expectancy. Mental exhaustion is another factor. People who work in stressful environments may burn out earlier and need rest and recovery after years of service. Moreover, increasing the retirement age could make it harder for young people to find jobs if fewer positions become available. It is also important to consider quality of life, as many people look forward to retirement to spend time with family, travel, or pursue hobbies. In summary, although people are living longer, I do not think this alone is a good enough reason to raise the retirement age considerably. Decisions about when people should retire should consider many different aspects, not just average lifespan."
951,2,Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,"Most of the citizens believe that, all countries should focus on producing more materials or items in their prime targets. Although some others think that, it is not a suitable target. I strongly agree with the idea of production and I will explain, why it is in this essay.
First of all, countries should have a strong economy to survive and meet their citizen’s expectations. And for the strong economy, they should produce new materials and do more researches to create new products and goods. So, governments should open new fabrics and research labs for the related sectors in order to create a big economy for their future. For example, they can give the opportunity to invent their own electronic vehicle in the country and this will allow everyone to buy it cheaper and easily instead of buying from other countries. Which is a best example of the importance of the new products.
On the other hand, some people believe that tourism and entertainment have big impact on the country’s economy. For example, even though Dubai is half desert nation, the government create a big tourism sector all over the world that everyone heard about the country’s name. Although, there are not any factories to produce materials or goods, but there are many entertainment actions such as Img world, legoland and many more inside the country. And these are working very well and taking attention of the other people for tourism purposes.
In conclusion, governments should give effort to produce and develop new products and goods for the country’s future. Although, they can also use the other opportunities to create a well economy for their people, such as tourism and the other sectors. But, in my opinion, they should have goals for more production and creation.",,,,,,6.5,"In today’s modern world, some people believe that every nation should focus on increasing its production of goods and materials, while others think this is not always the best goal. Personally, I believe that constantly increasing production is not always appropriate and may cause more harm than good. If countries only aim for more production, this can lead to overuse of natural resources, pollution, and environmental damage. For example, many factories release harmful gases into the air, which can create health problems for people and animals. Moreover, focusing only on physical goods ignores other important sectors of the economy, like education, healthcare, and technology, which also help a country develop. There are also rich countries that build their economies on services instead of only making products, such as Switzerland with banking and Singapore with trade. On the other hand, some level of production is necessary to provide jobs and money for citizens, but it does not mean that making more is always better. In conclusion, although increasing production can support the economy, I think governments should balance it with care for the environment and investing in other areas to create a sustainable and happy society."
953,2,Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,"Some think that the main objective of the countries should be the increment of production of materials and goods. I partially disagree that the constant increment in production is an appropiate goal becuase it has some negative consequences.
The idea of increasing constantly the production of materials and goods is based on the globalization process where each export and import goods and products, it is part of the globalise commerce. However, it is well-known that this practise represent negative aspects for the domestic economic and for the worldwide environment. For instance, in the free trade relationships between coutries, they negotiate the interchange of products, nontheless, in many times those trades produce a surplus or contrary a lack of products that increment the inflation or deflation of prices as a consequence of the invisible hand of Adams Smith that represent the offre and demand.
Addiotionally, the extraction of some natural resources such as gold, coal and crude are affecting drastically our planet. Consequences such as global warming, and huge amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are depleting the ozone layer. Therefore, these practices of production should be executed with the purpose of fullfil the needs of the society instead of make of this a profitable source. For instance, Natural resources should be only extracted to produce energy rather than consumed products such jewelry and so on. if we do not control our production of materials and goods, some natural disasters and social issues such as poverty and hunger will keep affecting human beings negatively.
In conclucion, although some people consider that each country should increment its production of raw materials and products as a main goal, I strongly believe that it is crucial to stablish a balance between this objective and others that affect our ecosystem and equity.",,,,,,5.5,"It is commonly believed that all countries should aim to continually increase the production of goods and materials. While it is true that growth in production can contribute to economic development and job creation, I do not fully agree that constantly raising production should be seen as a country’s main objective. Firstly, producing more and more materials often leads to overexploitation of natural resources, which can cause serious environmental issues such as deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and climate change. For example, when factories and industries keep expanding without considering sustainability, air and water pollution tend to worsen, affecting people’s health and the planet. Moreover, focusing only on increasing production can also result in social problems, like widening gaps between the rich and poor, as wealth becomes concentrated in the hands of those who control production facilities. It is important for countries to balance the goal of increasing production with protecting the environment and ensuring fair distribution of resources. Policies should encourage sustainable practices and responsible consumption, so that economic growth does not harm future generations. In summary, while boosting production has its benefits, I believe it is not an entirely appropriate aim for every country unless it is balanced with social and environmental priorities."
955,2,Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,"Numerous experts think that every country should be capable to produce more materials and commodities. I agree with this argument as it brings benefits to countries and I will highlight some of them.
To begin with, manufacturing goods is essential to any country as it helps to build their economy. Increasing production power assist them to export more and it also makes them less dependent on other countries. For instance, China is one of the largest producers in the world in any goods which also makes them the largest exporter. Such development in production power contributes to their gross domestic product.
Another reason is that extra produced goods can be used in emergencies, such emergencies are pandemics, financial crises and many more. By growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners. Moreover, countries should be aware that by increasing their production. For example, there is a semiconductor chip crisis is going on all over the world and no country in the world is able to meet the demands of chips. On the contrary, India is now planning to satisfy the demand for chips by strengthening its manufacturing capacity to a massive level while it will directly contribute to their economy and also generate job opportunities.
To conclude, I agree that more in-house production is necessary. It is extremely crucial to produce more needed products in order to consistently outperform the rest of the world and also it brings many beneficial things like generating job opportunities and a rise in the Gross domestic product of a country.",,,,,,6.0,"Many people believe that increasing a nation’s capacity to produce materials and goods should be a top priority. I largely agree with this idea because there are significant advantages linked with higher production. Firstly, when countries consistently expand their manufacturing sector, they often witness economic growth. The ability to produce more goods not only fulfills domestic needs but also enables countries to export surplus products, generating valuable income. For example, Germany’s strong industrial base has helped boost its economy and provided stable jobs for its citizens. Secondly, heightened production can decrease reliance on other nations, especially in times of crisis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, countries with robust manufacturing sectors were better equipped to produce medical supplies, reducing shortages. However, it is important to recognize that focusing solely on production may have drawbacks, such as overuse of natural resources and increased environmental pollution. Therefore, while I support the idea that countries should aim to expand their production, I believe it is essential to balance this goal with sustainable practices to avoid long-term harm. In conclusion, increasing production is generally beneficial, but it should be pursued responsibly to ensure both economic prosperity and environmental protection."
957,2,Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,"The population of our planet has been growing at a fast pace and thus meeting the demand for goods has become a tough achievement.
Some people, in order to face this issue, assume that every country should aim at producing more materials and goods.
I do not concur with this statement.
Rather than increase the production of goods and materials, a country ought to sensibilize its citizens not to dismiss goods that are still able to function properly.
Getting rid of goods that still work just because the new one has been released forces every country to produce more and more good, leading to a worsening of our enviroment.
Another pivotal factor that I would like to underline is the fact that people from developed countries do not have a shortage of goods. Not at all.
Consumerism is predominant in these areas and thus these countries should reduce their productions.
Most of the things they use daily are useless and they serve as amusement. I firmly believe a person can live perfectly without having 5 different cars.
In my opinion, the fact that a country should aim at increasing its production of materials and goods has another leak that I have briefly mentioned before: a higher level of production would lead inevitably to a higher level of pollution that would be consequently released into the natural environment.
Eath is already facing some very important issues when it comes to problems related to pollutions.
Lastly, I think that we should focus on how to produce less or, at least, on how to produce the same amount of goods and materials but in a more environment-friendly way.",,,,,,5.5,"Many people believe that the progress of a country is best measured by how many goods and materials it produces each year. However, I disagree with the idea that continuously increasing production is a goal that every nation should pursue. One major issue with this goal is the unsustainable strain it puts on natural resources, causing deforestation, water shortages, and pollution that harms both wildlife and human health. Furthermore, the constant push for more production often leads to an overabundance of goods that are quickly thrown away, contributing to massive waste problems. In wealthier countries, this drive for endless production has created a culture where people replace things not because they are broken, but simply because newer versions are available, which only deepens the cycle of wastefulness. Instead of focusing only on making more and more goods, countries should invest in making existing goods last longer and recyclable, and encourage their citizens to repair and reuse instead of always buying new things. Most importantly, nations should seek ways to balance economic growth with environmental protection, perhaps working to improve efficiency and quality rather than just quantity. Therefore, I strongly believe that increasing production indefinitely is neither a sustainable nor a wise goal for any country to set."
959,2,Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,"The view of how much goods and natural resources a country should produce differ massively. Some people are the view, that countries should increase their production and that this is an appropriate aim. I strongly believe, that countries should not increase their production of such goods and resources.
Firstly, the market will tell countries how much of these resources are needed. Therefore, the need of constantly enlarge their production is not necessary and additionally, a negative aspect can be, that companies will not be able to sell their products. By regulating production, countries areto make their products expensive if there is a high demand or cheaper if there are not enough buyers. For instance, if much steel for construction is needed, the countries which exploit that resource will be able to ask for a higher price.
Furthermore, countries with many natural resources can't access their goods at any time due to lack of machinery or power and workforce. For example, during the pandemic, many Chinese companies have been working in low mode. Now, that various countries have started to open up, China can not keep up with the demand and produce all the goods due to a power shortage, indeed. This development will bring many severe consequences for the local and international economy.
On the contrary, by growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners. Moreover, countries should be aware that by increasing their production, they can also make harm to the environment which will bring numerous consequences such as waste water pollution, high emission levels.
In brief, despite some short-term economic incentives, I strongly believe, as stated in the paragraphs above, that the need for that increase in goods and resources is not necessary.",,,,,,7.0,"Many individuals argue that the best objective for any nation is to continually raise the output of goods and materials. While economic growth can bring several benefits, I do not fully agree that an ever-increasing focus on production is the wisest goal. Firstly, increasing production beyond actual demand can result in wastefulness, unsold inventory, and negative impacts on prices and the economy. For example, if farmers grow more crops than people need, much of that food may spoil or prices may collapse, harming both consumers and producers. Secondly, the continuous expansion of factories and resource extraction often leads to environmental problems, such as more pollution, loss of natural habitats, and faster climate change. This can create long-term costs for society that outweigh the short-term economic gains. Of course, stable levels of production are necessary to support jobs, national development, and wellbeing, but countries should also prioritize efficient resource use, innovation, and sustainability over simply making more goods every year. In conclusion, while moderate production growth can help a country prosper, an endless push for higher production is not always appropriate and should be balanced with other important goals."

A vast number of people believe continuously increasing production should be the ultimate target to all nations. This enables to improve the country's economy and their citizens' livelihood. Whereas some people are deeply divided on it. This essay attempts to look at the main considerations of both sides.
It cannot be denied that mass production on materials and products in a country presents a certain capability of their businesses and industries which have sufficient human and financial resources to develop the country's local economy. In other words, there is a higher rate of employment in the country. The income of governments is derived through tax levied in effect of the economic activities, such as value added taxes and income taxes. The funding from taxes can be used by the governments to fulfill the community's various concerns. This enables to gain the government's prestige from the public. As a consequence, it urges the governments to constantly intensify in the economic development resulting in an increase of their popularity.
An increasing production for materials and commodities alone is raraly considerd enough to reinforce the economic development of the country in the long run. The well educated manpower is an indispensable factor of the economy. The youth who are with the innovative mindset and worldwide view is a dynamic force of the economic development in the future. It is essential for the goverments to cultivate the younger people through higher-quality universal education and academic freedom, instead of focusing on the current and short term achievement.
In addition, the improvement of the country's economy cannot solve all issues of the community. Not only is there concerns about the rate of domestic employment in the country, but also there is concerned with the quality of lives for their civilians in the community.

In fact, numerous people live on the street arising from the higher cost of living in New York. The government have obligation to figure out a matter of unequal distribution in wealth.
My take on this is that a healthy country cannot concentrate on the production of products only, short-term target. The other community's concerns, including the unequal distribution of the wealth and the prospects of the youth, play an important role in the country.

However, I believe that an endless pursuit of production may not necessarily lead to greater national welfare. Purely focusing on manufacturing can drive environmental degradation and resource depletion, which jeopardizes the well-being of future generations. Furthermore, the quality of life depends not just on the quantity of goods produced, but also upon social justice, equal opportunities, and sustainable practices. Some highly developed countries exhibit immense wealth, yet still face issues like environmental pollution and social inequality. Therefore, while expanding material production can be beneficial for economic growth, it should not be the sole or ultimate objective.

965,2,Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?,"Nowadays, it seems that the goal of every nation should mainly focus on economic purposes such as increasing production of materials and goods. However, I personally believe there are more important things than the economy, which governments should pay more attention to. For example, health systems, education, fundamental rights etc. Despite this, in my opinion, production should be also a main goal but it is also crucial for the well-being of the country, to make a balance among all objectives.
On the one hand, countries rely on the economy in order to make money, provide people with jobs and make a way of living. So I believe production of material and goods is essential in every economy. Nevertheless, constant increasing of production is not very healthy for the country, as it may end in a surplus of goods and materials. Moreover, the situation could get worse if companies would not know what to do with all the excess products.
On the other hand, taking care of inhabitants of a certain country is as important as producing. Without health, education and values, most nations would not survive. I also believe that you cannot have a strong economy without a healthy population, as people are the ones that work in production. In other words, both aims complement each other perfectly.

Furthermore, social issues like healthcare, education, and equality are just as vital to a country’s strength as the economy. In fact, if a nation ignores these areas and focuses only on producing more, the consequences might be a less educated or unhealthier population who cannot contribute effectively to the economy anyway.

In my opinion, buying products such as books, clothes or air tickets on internet have a lot of advantages that could balance the disadvantages.
Firstly, one of the positive aspect is that online it is possible to compare the same product at different prices in order to chose the best deal. Furthermore, we have the possibility to buy in a faster way, without wasting time and finding the best article. Indeed, in local shops it isn't always possible to find what we are searching for, while in the large shopping centre the research of the right thing takes time and it isn't so easy.
Another advantage of shopping on the Internet is that in a single website, such as Amazon, you can find multiple types of product, from book to clothes or furniture. In this way you can buy different things without spending too much time moving from one place to another.
On the other hand, buying online could have some disasvantages. For example, on the shopping websites there are lots of spam messages that offer you products at special prices.

One major benefit is the convenience—people can order anything from anywhere at any time, which saves effort and precious time, especially for those who have busy lives or do not have easy access to local stores. For example, my family often buys groceries online since it is much quicker than spending hours going to the supermarket and waiting in lines. Also, online shopping allows consumers to compare prices easily and hunt for discounts, something that can be difficult when shopping in physical stores. In addition, there is usually a wider selection of products on the Internet, meaning customers can find exactly what they want without having to visit multiple locations. On the negative side, there is a risk of receiving items that do not match the description or are of lower quality, and sometimes personal information can be at risk if the website is not secure. However, most reliable online shops now offer good return policies and improved security measures. All things considered, I think the benefits of online shopping, such as convenience, choice, and time saving, are stronger than the drawbacks, especially if people make purchases from trustworthy websites and are careful with their personal data."

Others value quality of work above appearance.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The way in which we dress has always been under a social relevance we cannot avoid. Since the antiquity clothes showed the difference social status of people and now they are a way in which person can show her personal attitudes. It is difficult to valuate the role of clothing in work places. On the one hand, there are organisations that strongly believe that the employees must dress in a peculiar, smart way. On the other hand, there are work places in which how people who worked there are dressed does not matter.
Although I believe it is important to be dressed in the right way with respect with different social moments, I strongly insist that a person must not be judged because of her syle.
Organisations who require a particular dress code in the work place, are moved from the idea that the way in which you are dressed show your personality more than you can imagine. In particular, they believe that to ask people to be smartly dressed will present the organisation itself as serious and reliable. Moreover, in some work-place the heads insists in requiring a style that will not say a lot about the personal attitudes of the employees. Then, to have a particular skirt or to wear a fency pair of shoes will show up the particular attitudes of a person and this could be evaluated as a weakness by different managers. For instance, there are offices in which all the employees has to wear suit and tie if men and skirt and heel if they are women. However, sometimes this way of acting cause troubles and emotional deseases that can affect the employees who are not confidend in wearing clothes that respect that particular dress-code. One of the most famous case in Italy concered the flight company Alitalia who asked the woman empoyees to always wear the skirt. Just after several strikes they obtained the permit to wear also pants.
On the other hand, there are organisations in which how employees are dressed does not matter at all. They believe the skills possessed by the workers go beyond a particular pair of shoes. To take another example, the skills of an employee have nothing to do with the color of her hair. Places like this consider a point of streengh the emotional and personal attitudes of the workers as well as they strongly believe that to show personal attitudes in a work context can give a major value to the work itself. Then, they decide to leave free people to dress as they want without any restriction.
In conclusion, I believe that the tendency to rule the way in which people should be dressed in the work place must be operated with high awarness. the CEO of an agency can propose an office syle without compromise the particular attitudes and feelings of the employees.",,,,,,6.0,"The question of whether employees should dress smartly or if their quality of work matters more is a common debate in modern workplaces. Many organisations insist on professional attire because they think smart dress projects a good image for their company to clients and customers. For example, banks and law firms often have strict dress codes, believing this formality helps build trust and shows respect for the organisation and its clientele. On the other hand, some companies, especially in creative or technology fields, allow employees to dress casually, focusing instead on the results employees achieve. For instance, in many tech startups, workers may come to the office wearing jeans and T-shirts, but they are highly valued as long as they meet or exceed their targets. Personally, I think a balance is necessary. While appropriate dress can be important in certain roles that require face-to-face interaction with customers, I believe that the quality of the work is ultimately the most important factor. If employees are productive and contribute positively to the organisation, what they wear should not be the main concern, unless their appearance directly impacts the company's image or operations."

Some companies give the opinion that their workers should have a smart look while others consider the attitude toward the job more important.
To my mind, appearance should not the only thing to be considered. We can dress smartly and impress others, but it is only the first impression. Therefore, productivity, quality of work, and the way we are responsible for our tasks are things that make us outstanding workers. Moreover, it is obvious that the success of one company does not depend on how its employees dress but on how it is organized.
In spite of the fact that dressing does not play a key role in the value of a worker, a neat and intelligent appearance still gives us significant benefits. I always suggest that one should dress suitably in different situations. In fact, it is not crucial for an organization to ask their employees to dress formally, but a set of smart casual clothes is something that we should wear when it comes to the working environment. It is because that wearing politely shows how we respect our jobs, our employers, and even our workmates. In some cases, a company's professionalism can be seen through the way its workers wear.
To sum up, dressing smartly is not the best and only thing that one worker can do to have better performance. However, having a good appearance is something that great employees would do since it can be considered as their respect for the jobs.",,,,,,7.0,"Some organisations argue that employees should present themselves in smart attire to maintain a professional image, thinking that how one dresses reflects not only the individual but the company as a whole. On the other hand, many workplaces are now putting more importance on the actual quality of an employee’s output, believing that talent, responsibility, and creativity are what truly drive a company’s success. Personally, I think while it is beneficial to look tidy and put together, it is much more essential to focus on the substance of the work. From my own experiences, especially in creative or tech-driven fields, I have noticed that teams often function better when people feel comfortable, even if that means dressing more casually. Yet, I understand there are industries, such as banking or law, where appearances can influence trust and credibility. Finding a balance could be the best approach, allowing some flexibility in dress codes without overlooking the value of first impressions. Ultimately, the real measure of any employee should be their dedication and results, not just their appearance, but dressing with a certain level of respect for the workplace can still make a positive difference."

For instance, technology firms often allow casual dress since their focus is on innovation and results, not appearances. I personally agree with the latter view, as the most crucial factor is the quality of work, not the clothes someone wears. Though presenting oneself neatly can be essential in certain roles, I think forcing everyone into formal attire can cause discomfort and reduce morale. Therefore, it is better for organisations to offer flexible dress codes that respect both the nature of the business and the preferences of their employees."

For this reason, attention should be given to colour schemes when decorating places such as offices and hospitals.How true is this statement?How far does colour influence people’s health and capacity for work?","The role of colors in our psycological life is crucial. Some people suggest hence to pay attention on color schemes when workplaces or hospital are decorated. I agree that colors affect people's psychological health. A particular place's decoration can arouse a determinate feeling that could favour or penalise the capacity of people in a work place.
Colors affect our psycological life. They possess an extraordinary social role. It is not a case that the famous table of emotions is presented in different colors where the different colors represent different emotions. For instance, blue incline people to be sad while red is said to be the color of passion, and move strongly the emotions of a person by setting of her pleasures. Lastly the grey's shades stimulate anxiety. Therefore, I think that the hospital's walls or officies cannot be decorated in grey or blue as long as it is better to stimulate their positiveness and productivity. Thre is a curious story about Princess Sissi, that confirm the impact of color in our life. She was obsessed about her wight and fitness. For this reason, she decored purple all the walls of her appartmanets. Indeed, pourple is said to be the color which stimulates the absence of hunger. Thus, when the princess was there it was easier for her to be fast.
By contrast, there are also some colors that stimulate fantasy, creativity and peace. Green is one of that color. Then, to decorate hospitals with green shades could be a good way to produce positive vibes in people who are sicks. Moreover, yellow is defined as the color that describes the feeling of being proud, aware and confident. Then, using this color in the walls of the officies will stimulate workers to do their better.

Colours such as blue and green have been shown to have calming effects, which can help reduce anxiety and promote healing in places where people are often stressed, such as hospitals. In contrast, bright and bold colours like red or orange can encourage alertness but may also increase agitation if used excessively. When it comes to productivity and concentration in workplaces, colours like light blue or soft green promote a relaxed atmosphere, helping people focus better on their tasks, whereas dull and monotonous shades may cause feelings of depression or boredom, lowering efficiency. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that individual preferences and cultural backgrounds can also influence how someone reacts to a certain colour, so a one-size-fits-all approach might not work everywhere.

Information technology is one type that has already changed a lot from the past. Information technology influences our daily life in many areas, such as home, leisure, and work activities. It positively affects human life, but it also has its disadvantage. I will give my opinion about how information technology influences our lives and the information technology has more benefit or cause more detriment.
Information technology improves human life in many different areas. First, it reduces the difficulty of communication. The technology we have right now gives us a faster and easier way to communicate with other who is far from us. Right now, whether we use social media or email, we can contact the people who are far from us immediately. The second part is information gathering; right now, we can get news everywhere, just on electronics, such as cell phones and TV. Also, information technology helps humans in information storage and process. This is the advantage of information technology.
Information technology significantly improves human life, but it also has some disadvantages. The first thing is to reduce the time people commute together face by face. Nowadays, classes, meetings, and work can all go online. As a result, we have less chance to meet and communicate; this reduces the ability to watch others' behavior and expression to speculate their feeling and emotion. The second disadvantage is that convenient technology lets people rely on it too much and reduces our ability to finish jobs without technology.
In my opinion, the advantage of information technology has way more influence on human life than the disadvantages. First, it helps us solve our problems with more accessible and faster information. This meets the fast rhythm of life in this era. Also, information technology may let people rely on it, but this is very general for humans because we always use anything we can use to solve problems quicker and more efficiently.

At work, advanced software and online tools enable employees to be more productive, communicate instantly, and even work remotely, which saves time and reduces stress from daily commuting. In addition, entertainment has become more accessible, as people can enjoy movies, music, and games from the comfort of their homes. However, there are problems such as people becoming less active or spending less time interacting in person. Overuse of digital devices can also lead to issues like eye strain or distractions from work or studies. Yet, many of these problems can be managed by setting boundaries and using technology responsibly. In my opinion, the ability to access information quickly, stay connected globally, and work efficiently means that the positive effects of information technology far outweigh the negatives."

However, the question: is dominating our lives by this technology have a negative or positive impact on our lives? Is considered one of the most controversial issues today. In this essay, I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints.
On one side of the argument, some people argue that the benefits considerably outweigh the disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is integrating technology in every aspect eases our lives and decreases hardworking. For example, advanced houses with integrated voice commands give the person the ability to achieve multiple tasks without any physical activity. Moreover, the technology allows people to connect multiple devices with an email address and control them remotely. One good illustration of that you can switch on and off your home AC while you are at work by the WIFI technology.
On the other hand, it is also possible to consider it with the opposing case. It is often argued that in fact using advanced technology increase the number of unhealthy people. People often have this opinion because people become lazier, and their daily activity dramatically decreases making them prone to diseases.
As we have seen, there are no easy answers to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that using advanced information technology should be limited to simple tasks, so at any point if a technical error happened you can resume your life without any obstacles.",,,,,,7.0,"There is no question that information technology has become a crucial part of our daily routines, from how we interact at home to the way we work and spend our free time.

With computers and smartphones, work can be completed remotely, allowing people to save time on commuting and improving their productivity. For instance, during the recent global health crisis, many people were able to continue their work and education online due to advanced technology. Furthermore, devices such as smart TVs and online streaming services provide endless entertainment choices without the need to leave home. On the other hand, some critics argue that there are real drawbacks, including increased social isolation and health concerns like eye strain and lack of physical activity. For example, excessive use of gadgets leads people to spend less time outdoors and interact less with family and friends in person.

While it is admittedly true that when used inappropriately, technology may expose us to a host of dangers and thus complicate our lives, it is, however, necessary for us not to overlook the benefits of technology to society. Given that technology changes many factors of our lives, I strongly believe that the advantages of it outweigh the disadvantages.
In terms of mobile phones bringing people closer together, these technological devices enable people to stay in touch no matter where they are. In the past, when people have to use telephones to contact with each other, is now replaced with social media, which is a convenient alternative for communication. For instance, smartphone applications such as email or WhatsApp, an instant messaging service, help people in different parts of the world interact with one another. Therefore, wireless communication networks facilitate communication and make people's lives easier and more convenient.

Wikipedia is an online, open-source encyclopedia that lets people browse for factual knowledge, and SCMP.com is a website which lets people catch up on the latest news. Conversely, if people carelessly use the Internet, they will result in discovering false messages, which readily mistaken their perspectives.

For example, at work, cloud-based collaboration tools like Google Drive enable people in different corners of the world to work together on projects in real time, thus improving both productivity and creativity. At home, smart devices simplify daily chores, allowing us to control lighting, temperature, and even security systems remotely. Moreover, leisure activities have evolved as streaming services and online games offer convenient entertainment options, connecting people even when they are physically apart.

Humans are social creatures and technology is helping us to socialize with others world-wide. Computers and the internet are the two products of technology that we use to connect with our friends, families and people. Despite where we live in, in today's world, we are able to talk with our friends almost anytime we want it. As a person who lives abroad, this advantage of technology makes my life a lot easier and helps me to feel less homesick.
Furthermore, with the improvements in technology, we are able to find the information that we looking for online and this would take possibly less than a minute. Search engines such as Google and Yahoo, is very helpful in this case. We can search the information in these platforms rather than going to public libraries, and they would provide in a short period. This speed can help us to improve and gain more information.

I believe that its positive effects truly have a bigger impact than the negative ones, although concerns do exist. To begin with, the convenience of using computers and smartphones makes tasks like online shopping, remote learning, and working from home possible, which saves time and energy for millions of people. For example, during the recent pandemic, students could continue their education online even when schools were closed. Furthermore, keeping in touch with family and friends is much easier now because of social networks and video calls. People can share joyful moments and offer help regardless of geographic distance. However, there are a few downsides, such as addiction to screens and the risk of personal data being stolen. It is also true that sometimes people forget to connect in real life because they are too focused on their devices. In conclusion, while there are problems to consider, I believe that when used correctly, the benefits of information technology, such as increased connection and convenience, far outweigh the disadvantages."

In my opinion, the advantages of information technology clearly outweigh its downsides for several reasons. Firstly, it has made tasks more efficient and accessible for people in various fields. For example, students are able to access vast amounts of information online, which helps them to study more effectively and independently wherever they are. Similarly, in workplaces, employees can coordinate projects and meetings no matter their location, enhancing productivity. Furthermore, information technology provides people with enjoyable sources of entertainment, such as streaming movies or playing online games with friends, making leisure time more convenient and diverse. However, it is true that there are negative consequences, such as an increased risk of cybercrime and threats to our privacy, as our personal details can be more easily shared or stolen online.

It is widely acknowledged that the internt can be a useful tool for learning. Taking advantage of the fast and variable resources and tools, many universities upload courses and materials in diverse fields of knowledge on the internet, so that any human anywhere can attend these courses and gain the information and expertise needed. For instance, anyone can attend a course from Harvard university and even acquire a certain degree online without having to travel to that university.
Furthermore, providing free online courses can contribute significantly to the society, by allowing students with low income families to be part of the educated community. Thus permitting more contribution to the world. A good example is the health care, psychology, and business courses given by Stanford university helped many people get their degree and be part of the workforce in these fields without paying expensive tuition fees.

First of all, making courses available online allows people from all over the world, including those living in remote areas or with busy schedules, to access quality education without the need to relocate or commute. For example, a person working full-time in a small town can now study engineering or computer science from a top university without leaving home. Secondly, online education often costs less than traditional classes, making learning more affordable for students who might not have enough money for expensive tuition and housing. In my opinion, this makes education fairer and more accessible for everyone. Additionally, online courses offer more flexibility, letting students learn at their own pace and review materials whenever they need. Of course, some people worry that online classes lack the personal interaction of face-to-face lessons, but many platforms now provide live sessions and discussion forums, so students do not miss out on collaborative learning.

Although online courses can never substitute the regular education, some benefits of online courses are undeniable. This essay will discuss both the advantegs and disadvantages of study through the internet.
Prima facie, education through internet has far more reach than any other method. Universities can approach students from all over the world, even a student from a remote area can be benefitted through the revolutionary internet courses. Online courses are also considered to be cost effective because a student can study from the comfort of home and save lot of living expenses.
While remote education reaches many students, it lacks in many ways. A physical classroom exeperience gives a student far more learning than the online one. Some practical subjects like Medical Science and Science require a lab facility and presence of students in the classroom environment. Theories can be still taught online but practical education is not feasible. Attending college also provides many mental health benefits, students connects with fellow studenst and teachers and create a social circle which in return result in healthy conversations and meeting. An healthy and happy environment is significant and helps people learn more quickly. Moreover a regular college education comes with many extra curricullar activities like sport, drama, music etc. I can never forget my college days where I enjoyed many youth festivals and sports event which helped in developing overall personality. Colleges provied many other benefit like socail gathering and focus on behaviroul aspect of students as well.
In a nutshell though online education comes with some good feature but can never replace the physical/regular education system.",,,,,,6.5,"Studying online through university courses on the Internet is becoming more popular today, and in my opinion, this is mostly a positive development. One main advantage is that online courses make higher education more accessible for people who cannot attend classes in person, such as those who live far away or have jobs and families to take care of. Students can learn at their own pace and save money on things like transportation and accommodation, making university study more affordable for many families. However, studying only online is not perfect because some important aspects of university life, like making friends, asking questions face-to-face, and doing practical work, are more difficult or even impossible on the Internet. For instance, laboratory experiments for science students require special equipment that students usually do not have at home. Nevertheless, I think giving students the option to study online is good because education becomes more flexible and adaptable to modern life. Personally, I have taken an online history class, and I found it helpful because I could watch lectures whenever I had time. Overall, while there might be some challenges, the expansion of online courses generally improves opportunities for people to get an education, making it a positive step forward."

In my opinion, this way of studing has both positive and negative aspects. This essay will argue why studing online can be unproductive for people.
The first reason why studing online is not good for a student is that is easier for him to lost the concentraiton during a lecture. For example, last year beacuse of the pandemic period, all students had to get class online, including me. It was a terrible year, because I stayed at home all the time and became very difficult listening lectures due to lot of things that capture my attention during lessons.
The other reason why getting class on the internet is a negative development is that the direct interaction between people is absent. I feel that this is the biggest drawback, because students are always alone in their room and they could become unsocial over the time. By contrast, the social life is important for everyone, because it help people to grow and share good and bad moment of the life. In addition, I think that is also important the dialoge with the teacher.
In conclusion, studing online can be a good solution for some people who need to stay at home and want to study at university, but in general it's a negative thing. In fact, is important for students to stay in a class with the teacher and other classmates to be concentrate during a lesson and to have the possibility to talk face to face with other people.",,,,,,6.0,"In recent years, universities have started to provide their courses through the Internet, allowing students to study remotely. I believe that this development has many benefits, but also some disadvantages. Firstly, being able to take classes online makes education much more accessible for people who cannot travel or live far from a good university. For example, last semester, my cousin who lives in a small town was able to join a well-known university in another country and study computer science from his own home, which would not have been possible without online lessons. However, there are also negative effects, such as reduced communication with teachers and classmates. When everyone is behind a screen, it can be hard to ask questions or make friends, and sometimes students feel lonely or less motivated. In my own experience last year, I missed the feeling of being with other students and discussing ideas face to face. In summary, offering courses online is a positive change because it opens opportunities for many students, but it also creates some challenges that should be considered to help students get the most from their studies."

Even before than COVID panemic caused so many restrictions for Universitues, some of the lectures there was already available online in the univerty website and everyone had easy and quick access to them.
However, I don't think this transition to the most classic lectures in the class could be replace with the online one, not all of them. As we reasonably assume, not all the lessons the are structured in the same way therefore result difficult to migrate all of them in an online version which present the same format and structure of presentation.
Although online courses, most probably, are the future of teaching some lessons require fisical activity. To reinforce my position against the full online courses, I have a personal example: I've parteciapated at one course called Organic farming which require from time to time a fiscally presence in the field. Therefore result quite complicated for me aptended a lesson about beekeeping without be next to the hive, this is happened to me not long ago, we were unable to attend the lesson because of the COVID restrictions.
Regardless the effort of the professor to address the lesson as best as he could, the resoult was not totally satisfy for me.
In conclusion I want to confirm my position against the online version of theacing, maybe I'm a bit old fashion and I can't see the future but I still like the classics lectures at the university with debates confrontations with others students and live the actmosphere of the university not from a screen.",,,,,,5.5,"With the increase of technology in modern life, it is understandable that universities start to offer more and more of their courses on the Internet so students can study online if they need. In some cases this is very positive, for example, people who live far from the campus, or have full time jobs, now they can access the education much easier without have to change their life entirely. During the COVID period, all of us saw how important it can be for education to continue without face-to-face meetings, and many students appreciated to have online videos or zoom lectures. However, I find that moving all courses to the Internet is not always good. Some subjects, especially practical ones like engineering or medicine, really need to be learned in person. I remember my friend who tried to study chemistry online, but he always told me experiments are not the same from just watching a video. Also, studying together in classroom is a social experience that helps people make friends and learn from each other, which is never the same at home alone with a computer. In my opinion, online courses are convenient and a great tool if used together with traditional ways, but universities should keep the chance for students to experience real university life and face-to-face learning as much as possible."

In the essay I will discuss how can we decrease the effect of climate change.
First of all, climate change caused by different reasons for example waste production by factories which is released in rivers and oceans.
Also carbon monoxide released by cars and other types of transportion. Also, community behiover such as use of plastic and non-recyclabe materils.
Secondly, we can as community reduce the effect of climte change on our enviroment by different ways. One of them is taking puplic transportion insted of using our own cars. In the matter of transportion, walking or using bicycles are the best for the climte because there is zero carbon monixide release. Moreover, replace the plastic bags with reusable ones will reduce the amount of waste.
In addition, goverments couled set rules and laws to control the amount of waste released in the enviroment. In Addition, planting more trees will have positive impact on the earth since they release more oxygen.
Howevere, climte change is unavoidable result of our current actions. If we continue to act in the same ways the earth will be destroyed by the pullution. I beleive goverments and communites coopration could minimize and delay the effect of climte change on the plant earth.",,,,,,6.0,"Climate change has become one of the most serious challenges facing our world today, and there are some who argue that instead of trying to stop it, we should learn to live with the new conditions. Personally, I strongly disagree with this opinion because preventing climate change is not only possible, but also necessary for the future of our planet. The main reason why we must try to stop climate change is that its effects are already harming millions of people through extreme weather, rising sea levels, and food shortages. If we simply accept these changes and try to adapt, future generations may suffer even worse consequences. For example, many coastal cities could be underwater in a few decades, and we might lose many animal and plant species forever. There are also many things we can do to slow down or even reverse climate change. Using renewable energy like solar and wind power, taking public transportation, and encouraging people to recycle more can all make a big difference. Governments should also make stronger rules to reduce pollution from factories and cars. In conclusion, while adapting to climate change is important, we must do everything we can to stop it from getting worse, for the sake of our planet and the people who will live here after us."

I fully disagree that people think it is better to develop technology to live with rather than try to decrease and solve the climate change.
In my opinion, if human could think about a way to live with climate change, it means that they have already thought, they failed to repared damages of global warming. Everyone should reduce their greenhouse gases thanks to their actions as wasting less, taking more public transports or stopping overconsumption. Even if local scale is a significant part to decline climate change, there are also governments and corporations which should decrease their polluting actions. Moreover, it is not as it could not work because during Covid's period when each country minimized its actions, the climate change slumped back and it is essential even crucial.
Futhermore, if people suggest to find a way to live with it, it illustrates that the entire Earth's planet could be collasped or may be destroyed. It depicts a negative perception of our forthcoming living's environment.
I am convinced this environment is not the quality of life that I would share to my offspring. If I had the power to solve the climatic issues, I would do everything I can and offer a better condition and prosperity of a healthy environment to the next generation.

In my view, accepting climate change as unavoidable is a sign of giving up on the health of our planet and future generations. Preventing climate change is still possible if we take strong actions collectively, such as reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, increasing the use of renewable energy, and making efforts to protect forests and oceans. For example, when countries came together for international agreements like the Paris Accord, they showed that global cooperation is not only possible but essential. Furthermore, simply adapting to the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels or extreme weather, often leads to higher costs and greater risks for vulnerable communities. If society focuses only on adaptation, we may create inequalities and worsen problems for those who are least able to protect themselves. Therefore, I believe it is our responsibility to strive for prevention first and foremost, both through individual actions like recycling and using public transport, and by supporting governmental policies aimed at reducing emissions. In conclusion, I strongly think that searching for solutions to live with climate change is not enough and may even be dangerous—we must prioritize prevention in order to secure a livable world for everyone."

However, others think the opposite, prevention of the climate change is essential. This essay will discuss why coping with climate change can be reasonable? .
preventing climate change have been priority number one in recent years. Whearase, the focus has been always in preventing or reducing the problem which is sound unrealistic. Many theories and predections of the issue start happening in these years for example, Floods, ice melt in the antarictic and extermely hot summers. So, talking about prevention is is away too late.
However, thats why finding a way to live with climate change sounds reasonable. I believe, plan out a futuristic cope for the next generation will be more applicable than, start to prevent essentials that helped in buiding the civilization. For instance, gas factories, greenhouses and oil. However, reducing the impact of these products is a good idea, hence not shut it down.
To conclude, climate change is a series issue need a good attention and not that attention promoting lately. promoting to prevent something already happening is impossible. This issue need a reasonable realistic plan that make living with it more easier and effective.",,,,,,6.0,"The issue of climate change is now a global concern, and people have different opinions about whether we should prevent it or adapt to it. Some believe it is too late to completely stop climate change, so the best option is to find ways to live with its effects. I partly agree with this idea because, in many regions, rising sea levels and extreme weather are already part of daily life, and communities are forced to adapt by building stronger homes or relocating people. For example, some cities like Venice have invested in technology to protect themselves from flooding. However, I also think we cannot stop trying to prevent climate change. If we only focus on adapting, the situation might get much worse in the future, especially for poor people who do not have resources to adjust. Making efforts to reduce pollution, use clean energy, and protect forests is still important and can make a big difference in the long run. In summary, while we should learn to adapt to the changes that are happening now, we must not give up on preventing more serious problems caused by climate change in the future."

I completely disagree and will state side of my view.
The reason why some people hold to this argument is because global warming is difficult to control. For example, there are no control measures on second hand cars bought in Botswana people end up buying old damaged cars. Consequently they end up emmiting smoke and have an impact to the climate. Other reason is, people they do not follow polices implemented by the government making it hard to prevent harm to climate. For instance, policy made in Botswana that people should get permits to cut trees but instead they do that without them. Above reasons are good enough to people to think that they
should find ways to live with global warming issues instead of preventing them.
Nethertheless, I beileve global warming can be preventable and cannot be accepted because it is harmful. It can damage our eco system. Reason being,people cutting treess will lead to less of them thus more carbon dioxide in the climate which is harmful to survival. Also it can lead to less rainfall being produced, resulting to less food being produced and no water. Therefore flora and fauna will suffer as well as human beings. Lastly due to climate change it can happen that the sun will burn plants in farms, that is less food produced then people will suffer. The government should put policies in place and make sure people abide by them to prevent global warming.
To conclude, though some people believe to find ways to survive with climate change I am against that as the damages caused by it are of more significance. Climate change needs to be prevented by all means as it is dangerous to eco system and government should find strict laws to save it.",,,,,,6.0,"Some people believe instead of trying to stop climate change, we should focus on adjusting to its effects. However, I strongly disagree with this view because the dangers of climate change are too severe to simply accept. Even though it is true that climate change is a global problem and can seem hard to control, prevention is still possible if everyone takes responsibility. For instance, factories and cars release greenhouse gases into the air, which cause the earth to warm up. If we do not act to reduce these emissions, weather will become more extreme, such as stronger storms and more droughts. These changes would destroy crops and create food shortages, making life harder for everyone, especially in poor countries. Furthermore, rising sea levels due to melting ice could flood cities near the coast and force millions of people to move. Some people say it is easier to adapt, like building seawalls or using new farming methods, but these solutions are not enough. They are expensive and may not work everywhere. The government should enforce laws to protect the environment and encourage people to use cleaner energy. In my opinion, preventing climate change is necessary because living with its effects would be too dangerous and could harm both people and nature in the long run."

There are many disadvantages of climate change which can gradually push animals and also human to extinction. First and foremost, climate change promote the process of global warming which is one of the most dangerous result of climate change. Because of this situation, ice in 2 polar areas is melting day by day. As a result, the level of sea water will go up. Therefore, countries which are near by the sea may be drown in the future. Another drawback of climate change is that it causes many disaster. The figure for disaster is predicted to increase because of climate change. Hence, people and animals will have to deal with many dangerous disaster which can bring a lot of damage.
Beside, I believe there are also many way to prevent climate change. Firstly, from my perspective, education is the best way to deal with the changing of climate. Because education raises the awareness of people about how dangerous climate change is, and it also teach people to protect the environment. Therefore, the effect of climate change will decrease. Secondly, local community should hold more volunteer activity for people to clean the palace where they live, so people can make sense of environmental protection and their neighborhood will also be cleaned. This activity can also contribute to prevent climate change

Firstly, allowing climate change to progress unchecked will likely cause extreme weather events to become more common, such as stronger hurricanes, prolonged droughts, and intense heatwaves, which can threaten both human life and natural ecosystems. For example, in recent years, wildfires in places like Australia and California have shown how climate change can make natural disasters much worse. Secondly, I believe that preventing climate change is possible if people take action together. Education can help people understand the problem better, and governments can introduce laws to lower carbon emissions and encourage green energy. Moreover, by planting trees and recycling waste, individuals and communities can also help reduce the negative impacts. In conclusion, I think we should not just try to live with climate change, but instead focus on preventing it, because the risks of ignoring it are far too great for the world."

While some people believe that we should take actions to prevent its affects, others think we better understand it and do some adjustments in our lives accordingly. In my opinion, I think it would be better if we can prevent it to have better life for us and future generations, instead of just living through it because we witnessed similar events in the history. In this essay, I will express my opinion with discussing both point of views.
One of the biggest advantage of humans compared to other creatures is its adaptibility. Humans faced serious natural disasters in the past and climate change was just one of them. With the adjustment skill that we have, we always found a way to stay alive and made it through until today. From this prespective, today's changes in climate change can be accepted and with a few adjustment in our life styles, it can be treated as another disaster in history that humans have been through.
However, if we do changes to learn live with climate change, it will cause us to drop our life quality in daily bases. For instance, air pollution will become a huge problem with the climate change and if we just adapt ourselves to live with it, we have to wear face masks everyday to reduce its harmful affect to our metabolism and this will limit our breathing. On the other hand, if we try to prevent climate change, we can keep the same way that we are living today. Furthermore, if we take serious actions to stop climate change, we have a chance to raise our life quality not just for today but also for the future. We can live in a world which has more green areas and this way, we can provide better environment to our childeren.

Some argue it would be more realistic to learn how to live with it, rather than spending effort and resources on preventing it. On the other side, some people strongly believe that humanity should focus on stopping or at least minimizing the harmful effects of climate change. Personally, I believe that prevention is far more important, even if adapting to climate change is also necessary to some degree. If everyone simply accepts the drastic changes in weather, rising sea levels, and loss of biodiversity, the situation could quickly get worse and threaten future generations. As an example, cities that are now experiencing frequent floods due to higher sea levels might spend money to build barriers or improve drainage, but these are only temporary solutions. If nothing is done to lower greenhouse gas emissions, the problem will only continue to grow. On the other hand, if we invest in renewable energy sources, reforestation, and reducing pollution, we may not only slow down climate change but also improve everyone’s lives with cleaner air and better health. To sum up, while adapting to climate change is unavoidable to some extent, focusing on prevention is much more effective if we care about the quality of life for ourselves and those who come after us."

Human history proves that people can change their behaviours to survive harsh conditions, like building stronger houses after floods or creating new farming techniques during droughts. However, simply adjusting to climate change, like using more air conditioning during hotter summers or building sea walls against rising oceans, may not be enough in the long run. For example, if people continue to live with climate change without slowing it, more extreme storms and wildfires will likely damage towns, hurt the economy, and threaten people's health. Instead, by working to prevent climate change through reducing pollution, using renewable energy, and protecting forests, we can keep the environment in a healthier state for ourselves and the next generation.

Some people believe that this is good for the country, but others think that governments should not allow salaries above a certain level.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In numerous countries, few individuals earn a considerable income. Despite the outrageous salary that people could have, many consider that government ought to submit a limit of wages. However, others believe that is profitable for their nation.
Thinking to all poverty that there are in the world, I can understand why some individuals estimate to not allow indecent wages. In my opinion, a larger number of people who earn significant salaries always waste their money into useless luxuries to show off. However, when we can see some household which have numerous jobs to keep the wolf from the door, it seems obvious that governments should impose restrictions on income. In addition, even if individuals sometimes deserve their wages, if government had their billions which are in their bank accounts, it would help millions of inhabitants for numerous issues. It could benefit to the general interest, namely, to reduce starve, poverty or even maybe find a cure for cancer.
Nevertheless, I would say that individuals deserve their salaries because most of the time, people who earn a considerable living create employment such as Chief Executive Officer. Thanks to their ingenuity and their leadership, this small number of geniuses build corporation which give to thousands of persons a full-time job. Indeed, citizens must not forget that everyone pay taxes hence, for example, if a businessman had a heavy income, he would pay higher taxes than everybody. Furthermore, this gap between salaries could also be justified due to different level of studies or responsibility which lead to distinct income.
To conclude, even if in each country, there are heterogenous wages with a huge gap, each view is completely understandable. However, thinking to submit restrictions on salaries, could lead to a reduction of country’s development.",,,,,,6.0,"It is common to see a small minority of people earning extremely high salaries in many nations, and this situation has sparked much debate. Supporters of such high incomes claim it motivates innovation and hard work, benefitting the economy as successful businesspeople often create jobs and contribute significantly in taxes. For instance, tech entrepreneurs who build global companies not only earn large sums themselves but also provide employment and drive technological progress. On the other hand, opponents argue that allowing huge pay gaps increases inequality and resentment, while the money concentrated in the hands of a few could be better used to address basic needs like education and healthcare. Countries such as Sweden have attempted to reduce pay differences through taxation, aiming for a fairer society. Personally, I believe that while rewarding talent and effort is important, governments should intervene when incomes become excessive compared to average salaries. Modest salary caps or progressive taxation would enable societies to use wealth more wisely, ensuring growth benefits everyone, not just a privileged elite."

It is believed by some that this is an advantage for the country, while it is thought by others that governments should put a limit above which salaries cannot be.
In my opinion, I believe that not only people have to be rewarded for their performance, but also their wage salary has to be proportional to the benefits that they are leading to the country.
For instance, due to the Covid a lot of people suffered several injuries which were cured only thanks to the doctors and the nurses. For this reason, since they are saving lifes everyday,
it seems unbelievable the fact that they are earning much less money than football players.
Another example can be found in people involved in the national security: I believe that it would be fairer if these professionals were paid more than an influencer.
However, in our society this figures (such as doctors) are paid by governments through taxes, while football players or influncers gain incomes by private companies.
In order to not impose an heavier taxation, politics should categorise jobs basing on their importance in the society. Hence, we will have a specific amount that these employers can earn.
Thus, if these no-fundamental workers (like actors or actress) are earning more money than the precise level chosen, these will be used as funds to increase life-saving jobs' salary.
In conclusion, I believe that highest salaries should exist only if we are referring to a job that is needed by everyone.",,,,,,5.5,"In many countries, it is true that only a select few earn enormous wages compared to the majority of workers. Some argue that allowing people to have such high incomes is positive because it can encourage ambition and attract the best talent, which may help the country's economy grow.

On the other hand, some people feel that it is unfair for an individual to earn so much money when so many others struggle to make ends meet, and they suggest that governments should set a maximum limit on salaries. They believe that if there was a salary cap, more funds could be used for public services or distributed more equally. Personally, I think there should not be a strict limit on salaries, but governments should tax the ultra-wealthy more and ensure everyone gets a basic standard of living. In my view, this approach still allows talented people to be rewarded for their efforts while helping to reduce the gap between the richest and the poorest in society."

Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"As society becomes more and more saturated with technology, traditional cultures are losing their roles in society. The compatibility of technology and traditions are often debated where some suggest it is possible, whereas, others argue it is not. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and conclude by saying how and why it is almost impossible.
Since people usually appreciate limited ways of living, it is challenging for both conventions and technology to co-exist. They will usually choose one method or another but not both at the same time. For instance, a company would have to focus on using human labour or advanced machineries to produce a product. The incompatibility may not be obvious at first but as technology develops futher, use of machines will increase but employment will decrease. Furthermore, technology is often considered to be more convenient and faster by many people. Work can be done more efficiently so workers will start to abandon the old ways of living or working.
In contrast, it might be possible for two values to work along in society due to different tastes of various people. Traditional cultures are usually appreciated by old generation such as grandparents, meanwhile, new generation prefers technology in their life. For example, grandparents can read newspaper while grandchildren watch TV or play games during family time. Moreover, although it is hard for a company to use both at the same time, it is not totally impossible. If the number of machines is controlled during production, human labour and machines can work together to maximise productivity by covering up each other's disadvantages.
All in all, even though traditional values and technology can be compatible theoratically, it is indeed difficult to compromise the use between two in real life. Ergo, people would have to beware of the risk of losing traditional cultures, if at all.",,,,,,7.0,"With the rapid advancement of technology, many people fear that traditional cultures are at risk of disappearing entirely. Some argue that modern innovations and longstanding customs simply cannot coexist, suggesting that society must choose between embracing progress or holding onto the past. In my opinion, while technology can sometimes challenge traditional practices, it does not automatically mean that cultures must be lost; rather, they can adapt and even benefit from new tools. For example, many traditional festivals and ceremonies are now shared online, allowing younger generations to connect with their heritage in new ways. Additionally, the internet has made it possible for indigenous languages and stories to be recorded and passed down more easily than before. Still, there is some truth to the concern, as certain customs that rely on older ways of working—such as handcrafting goods or oral storytelling—may struggle to survive in a fast-paced digital world. Ultimately, although there are tensions between technology and traditional culture, the two are not inherently incompatible. Instead, the challenge lies in finding a balance that preserves valuable traditions while still taking advantage of technological advancements."

Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Many people hold the view that traditional culture and technological development cannot coexist as the latter catch on, the former will be bound to disappear. I totally disagree with this because both can be implemented jointly by putting technology at the service of tradition and through pilot projects.
To begin with, technological progress, which is making major strides in our daily lives, is the means by which local mores, custom and traditions could be brought back to life, proving they are compatible. In fact, by tapping technology to make tradition far more attractive, considerably more audience will be engaged into such activities. Bologna is a case in point, since, thanks to digital machines and drones which have supported housewives into the making of , the traditional celebration of “making pasta day ” has recently being turned into a successful events, which draws people from country as far afield as China.
Another example of possible coexistence is the possibility to heighten awareness of people costumes through the creation of pilot projects which bring both habits and technology to a new whole level. This can be put into practice by setting a direct connection to cultural heritage of a specific area of the world to those who do not have access easily. To this end, many primary schools in New York have developed a project in which, owing to the ultimate high speed connection, pupils who come from abroad can learn ancient craft directly from a master located in their country of origin.
To conclude, I firmly believe that traditional culture and technology development are widely compatible as the technology can positively beef up the presence of cultural traditions nowadays, so as to keep its memory Alive. In addition, pioneering projects can be implemented to underpin cultural awareness amongst youngsters.",,,,,,7.0,"There is a common assumption that the advancement of technology inevitably erodes traditional cultures, as if these two aspects of society cannot coexist. However, I largely disagree with this perspective since technological development often provides new means to preserve, celebrate, and transmit cultural heritage to future generations. Firstly, technology enables the recording and sharing of traditional music, dance, and storytelling, making it possible for people globally to access and learn about diverse cultures in ways that were previously unimaginable. For instance, Indigenous communities in Australia have used social media and digital archiving to share their languages and rituals, ensuring their continuation. In addition, technology can revitalize old customs by presenting them through new platforms such as virtual reality, allowing users to experience unique cultural ceremonies from their own homes. Another relevant example is how online platforms help craftspeople sell their handmade goods internationally, supporting local economies and artisans who keep traditional techniques alive. In conclusion, although thoughtful regulation is needed to avoid the commercialization of culture, I believe technology and traditional culture can not only coexist but also flourish together when leveraged thoughtfully and creatively."

The author agree with the statement that the technology and traditional cultures may find it hard to co-exist. As the reserach and development of human beings increases the birth of new technologies are inevitable. When a new technology is invented, mostly the new member of our living environment disrupts the traditional standards.
For example, prior to the internet era we used to communicate less through the mobile devices and tend to have face to face conversations. This is often true while considering a chat between our family members. On occasions like birthday, a festival season like Christmas we used to go in person to greet the loved ones. However, as technology evolved and traditional jobs are swept away people migrated to locations with more opportunities and often these are far from the native places. This situation along with the communication platforms built above internet like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat make us feel like we do not have to travel so far just to wish for a special occasion when we can do the same easily on a mobile device.
From the authors experience it is clearly understood that he traditional cultures are now covered by the clouds of new technologies which threatens the survival of many hunam beings. For example, with the innovation in the banking sector, the customers are now able to transact through their mobile application. They do not have to visit the brick and mortar braches anymore. If this trend continues then many professionals in the banking industry will be laid of within next couple of years.",,,,,,5.0,"It is often argued that as technology progresses, traditional cultures inevitably fade away because the two cannot coexist. However, I partially disagree with this statement. While it is true that many aspects of traditional life, such as customs, languages, and forms of socialization, have been altered or even diminished due to technological advancements, I believe technology can also serve as a tool to preserve and promote cultural heritage. For instance, social media and video sharing platforms have allowed people around the world to showcase their cultural dances, music, and even traditional recipes, making them accessible to a much broader audience than would have ever been possible. Moreover, various communities have used modern technology to document and archive endangered languages or rituals, thereby keeping them alive for future generations. From my own experience, I have learned about different world festivals and ancient traditions through online documentaries, something that would not have been imaginable without the internet. While there is no doubt that certain traditional practices may be lost or replaced, technology itself does not have to be at odds with tradition; rather, its effect depends on how thoughtfully it is used by individuals and society."

As sad un-realistic as it may sound, it is the truth. Enhanced technology and our traditional cultures are just not compatible, leaving only one to emerge victorious out of the two.
What I feel about this topic is a mixture to both agree and disagree with it, because there are both plus and negative sides to this.
Talking about the Plus sides, life will become easier. Traditional culture does not only refer to the festivities, customs, norms etc. It refers to the 'life' as a whole, which is slower than the more enhanced life brought to us by technological developments. A great example of this is the invention of the car. Before the earliest cars were invented, horses would pull carriages over long distances. The invention of the first car was a huge upgrade from these animals driven-vehicles and were beneficial too. The first and most obvious benefit was that money was saved. The horses that pulled the carriages were living things, and would die one day, causing these carriage drivers to spend loads of money on the best-quality horses. That was all replaced with the invention of the first car, making it only a one-time investment for the drivers.
The negative side to this is that many centuries' old traditions that hold a high level of nostalgia for communites will one day disappear. Many Indegineous african communities that have upheld their traditions for hundreds of years, are disappearing due the better job opportunities provided by technology developments.

Furthermore, technology can help preserve valuable cultural artifacts, oral histories, and music by converting them into digital formats. Personally, I have seen younger generations in my own community using technology to learn about traditional dances and recipes, which probably would have been forgotten otherwise.

For example, the rise of smartphones and the internet has made handwritten letters and in-person gatherings less common, leading to a decline in certain customs related to communication. However, it is also true that technology offers ways to preserve and even revive traditional cultures, such as through digital archives of music, art, and oral histories that might otherwise be forgotten. Additionally, some cultural festivals and rituals have gained new life by being shared on social media, reaching wider audiences than ever before.

Some people argue that, they both can not go well each other on side and I completely agree with statement. In this essay, i will explain how technology affects a culture in a bad way.
Firstly, media has played important part in damaging to cultures in the world. Next to that, modern technology has more advancement in telecommunication department that turned the world into global village. Furthermore, whatever is available in one corner of the world can easily found in another one , so that, it is damaging the uniqueness of any area. People more prefer to eat western food compare to traditional hence, country's street market has also need to change in their favours and cuisine. More and more people in Asian countries, for example, are copying the styles of American outfits and street foods in India are widely replaced by KFC and Mcdonalds. Hence, media play a crucial role in culture to become less distinctive.
On controversy, while development in technology makes people life easier, it also changed the way we live. The introduction of new appliances like the microwave and electric grill has radically changed the traditional cooking. People no longer spend time in kitchen to make food for themselves as they were used to do before. In addition, development in travel and tourism can much affordable to travel in other countries and one can be easily explored the world by advance facilities. Everytime, when a tourist visits a country, they bring with it own culture and it leaves some impression on the local people. For example, a great number of people in India started wearing jeans after the development of tourist attraction in the area. Hence, the link between the evolution of technology and culture damage can be seen.
In conclusion, I totally agree with the statement that while technology brings comfort to life , it makes the cultures vague and indistinctive.",,,,,,4.5,"It is often said that as technology continues to advance, our traditional cultures are at risk of disappearing, and some argue that these two forces cannot exist together. I believe there is some truth to this view, but I also think it is not entirely accurate. Technology has certainly made the world more connected, reducing the differences between cultures; for example, social media encourages young people everywhere to adopt similar trends in music, dress, and language, which can weaken local customs and traditions over time. In many families, traditional festivals or ceremonies are no longer celebrated as before, as people are more interested in online entertainment and gadgets. On the other hand, technology can also help preserve traditional cultures by making it easier to share information about them. People can now learn about their own history through digital archives and promote their unique customs to a global audience using platforms like YouTube or Instagram. In my opinion, while technology can sometimes damage traditional cultures, it also provides opportunities to keep them alive in new ways, so the two are not necessarily incompatible. Therefore, I only partly agree with the idea that traditional cultures must inevitably be lost as technology develops."

Firstly, such extreme sports should not be banned as they are also sport just like any other sport. furthermore, major sports like cricket are also not the safest to play as the ball is made of solid leather it can put crack on someone's head which is extremely dangerous. extreme sports are meant for enjoyment and they also help to release some stress.
Secondly, if such sports are conducted properly then it should not be as dangerous like there should be guidelines where they make sure that pieces of equipment are in excellent condition and where they do make sure a safety check.
Lastly, despite being extreme, many find themselves indulging in such activity because it helps them reduce their stress at work or home. The reason is that when we engage in sports, our body releases oxytocin, a hormone that alleviates stress and helps us feel more relaxed and peaceful unlike when we are bombarded with phone calls or emails from clients.
In conclusion, I disagree with the eradication of extreme sports as it provides thrills and also boosts someone's confidence as they move beyond their limitation. people all around the world love to indulge in such activities where they feel an adrenaline rush in their whole body.",,,,,,6.0,"Extreme sports such as sky diving and skiing are often criticized for being very dangerous, with some people arguing that they should be banned altogether. However, I strongly disagree with this perspective, as I believe that banning these activities would be unnecessary and unfair. To begin with, all sports carry some level of risk, and with the proper safety precautions and training, participants can minimize the dangers involved. For example, sky divers undergo comprehensive instruction and use special equipment designed to protect them, while skiers are generally required to wear helmets and follow marked trails. Additionally, engaging in extreme sports offers unique benefits, such as boosting self-confidence and providing a sense of achievement that cannot be found in more conventional pastimes. Many people also use these sports as a way to conquer their fears and challenge themselves, which can be very rewarding both mentally and physically. Rather than banning extreme sports, it would be better to focus on promoting education about safety and encouraging responsible participation. In summary, I believe extreme sports should not be banned, as they offer valuable opportunities for excitement and personal growth, as long as sensible precautions are in place."

Anyway, a lot of people think that this types of sports are very dangerous and should be banned. This essay will talk about extreme sports giving my own opinion about the idea of banning this activities because of their risks.
Practicing a sport is very important for the general health of a person; a lot of people choose to practice dangerous sports, like skiing, because of the adrenaline and the sensation that it brings to you. Sports of this type can help you to go over your fear and they will help you to see life from a different perspective.
Anyway, the risks that an athlete will go through are many; every year the amount of people that have injuries or, sometimes die, because of this types of activities are numerous. Especially with skiing, a person should never go alone in places that don't have the right equipment to guarantee a safe experience; many times when practicing this types of sports, athletes from all over the world decide to go over their limit going to practice in zones that are known to be dangerous or unsafe and, in this cases, the possibility of something bad to happen is high.
Personally, I think that when you want to practice or experiment a sport that is extreme you should take all the right prevention to make the experience as safe as possible to avoid any injuries. Practicing sports is important but it is also fundamental to try your best to avoid injuries when practicing it. This essay talked about extreme sports and their risk, giving my own opinion at the end.",,,,,,7.0,"Extreme sports like sky diving and skiing are often thought to be very dangerous, leading some people to argue that they should be banned. However, I do not fully agree with this idea because I think extreme sports can offer many valuable experiences if they are practiced responsibly. Many people are attracted to these activities because they provide excitement and a sense of achievement that ordinary sports might not give. For example, I know someone who overcame his fear of heights through regular skydiving and it made him more confident in all parts of his life. It is true that accidents sometimes happen in extreme sports, but dangers can be reduced by following safety rules, using professional instructors, and having the necessary equipment. In fact, many everyday activities like driving a car also involve risks, but we do not ban them; instead, we try to make them safer. In my opinion, rather than banning extreme sports, it is better to educate people about the risks and make sure the right safety measures are in place. This way, people can enjoy these unique experiences and challenge themselves while also staying as safe as possible."

In this essay, I will discuss two opposite attitudes of modern people to some traditional celebrations and give example and some advice to the issue.
On the one hand, it seems that the majority of people does not care about the reason of holidays, they are ready to enjoy them without any concrete reasons. First of all, that happens usually because of the fact that many people overwork and do not live in their work-life balance, so they are very glad to have additional day-off. The second explanation to the issue can be that people follow some traditions from ancient times, so some of those traditions became as a routines, that the basic meaning could be forgotten during the times. But nations continue folloving some customs just because they got used to them, even if they do not remember the main purpose of the celebration. The third reason to that can be that young generation do not understand some of their ancestors traditions, so they just accept some festivals from their predecessors as days when they are able to make their lives brighter and enjoy themselves.
On the other hand, there are exist people who know the basics of festivals and familiar with the hystory of traditions in their countries. Such kind of people usually consern about their traditions and pay more attantions to some specific atributes of festivals, which can be symbolise health, wealth, success, or maybe femily hapiness, et cetera. In my opinion, it would be beneficial if the main purposes of some, especially ancient, traditions, to be explained to others. First of all, people would become familiar with some old customs and maybe partly could understand the reasons why their ancestors used some kind of colors and accesuars during that holidays. Additionally, people would know better the histories of their countries and share those knowledge with younger generations. So, the youth could not only enjoy themselves during celebrations, but also become more intelligent about traditions in their homelands.
To sum it up, it is widely spread attitude on holiday organisation as to only having entertainment, dancing, and having wonderful moods during those days. However, if the history of festivals and ancient traditions is spread properly, people become more wisdom about the main reasons of those celebrations in their countries.",,,,,,6.0,"It is sometimes claimed that during festival periods, most people these days just want to relax and have fun, while the original meaning behind traditional or religious celebrations is often forgotten. While I understand why some think this way, I do not completely agree. On the one hand, it is true that for many, festivals have become a time to enjoy life, take a break from work, or spend time with friends and family, rather than reflect on the tradition’s deeper purpose. For instance, during Christmas, people are sometimes more excited about exchanging gifts and having a big meal than considering the holiday’s religious roots. The same can be said for cultural festivals like Lunar New Year, where fireworks and social activities may take center stage. However, I believe that there are still plenty of individuals and families who make an effort to remember and honor the original meanings during these occasions. Many parents teach their children about the stories and values behind festivals, such as forgiveness, gratitude, and togetherness. Schools and religious institutions also hold educational events to explain why these celebrations exist. In my view, while the desire for enjoyment has become stronger in our modern, fast-paced world, the essential meanings are not completely lost. Instead, they continue to be passed down in ways that suit today’s society, blending enjoyment with tradition. Therefore, it would be unfair to say most people have totally forgotten the real reasons behind these important days."

A great example of this is in India during the nations' biggest festival, Diwali. Diwali is celebrated across the nation in the month of October for it was when Lord Rama, the greatest hero of our holy Hindu scriptures returned victorious from his battle in Lanka by defeating the demon king, Ravana. Traditionally, there used to be mass 'pujas' (worship ceremonies) held in every nook and corner of the nation, you could literally find and join a puja ceremony anywhere you went in India.
Although they are still held, the new generation of Indian youth proudly known as 'Gen-z', is starting to abandon the true meaning of this festival by mending it in their own way. Instead of spending money to call over the poor and homeless to their homes to give them a meal (like what was traditionally done), they are using all that money on partying and gambling in the 'name of Lord Ram and religion'. I personally find this utterly disgusting and disrespectful. Although it is a much more eco-friendly method of celebrating than bursting crackers, I feel that it is like you are spitting in the face of Lord Rama.
The case of India and Diwali is just one of the many ways people are abandoning festive traditions to just enjoy themselves and not give back to the society (like the purpose is in at least all Hindu festivals).
At the end of the day, it depends of which country and it's festival. If you look like a nation like China, their grandest festival, the Chinese New Year as depicted in the picture given below, has still not lost it's authenticity. They still hae the same traditons intact as they were when it was first ever celebrated thousands of years ago.
But as a whole, traditional and religious festivals are losing their true meaning becasue of the intention of the youth to just enjoy themselves.",,,,,,6.5,"In recent times, I have noticed that the true meaning behind traditional and religious festivals is slowly fading away, as more people focus on entertainment rather than understanding their roots. For instance, during Christmas, which was originally established to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ and promote kindness and generosity, many people nowadays only look forward to receiving presents and attending lavish parties. The spiritual aspect of the holiday is often overshadowed by consumerism and a strong desire to enjoy time off work or school. Similarly, in my own culture, the Lunar New Year was once a chance to reunite with family, honor ancestors, and pray for prosperity in the coming year. Sadly, I see many of my peers using this occasion only as an excuse for firework displays and large banquets, rarely stopping to reflect on the historical and religious significance of the rituals passed down from our elders. While it is true that some families do their best to uphold traditional customs, I agree that the majority of people prioritize having fun over respecting the deep meanings of these festivals. This trend, in my view, threatens the preservation of cultural heritage for future generations, and I believe there should be more emphasis on educating young people about the origins and values associated with traditional celebrations."

The following essay will fully endorse the statement and examine the reasons behind it.
Firstly, there are several reasons why people forgot about the message behind celebrations. One of the most significant one is globalisation. As people start connecting with each other through social media worldwide, many people are too distracted with the latest trends and updates. A study from Yales University mentioned that 60% of the population on earth do not persuit the stories about their traditional roots and background. Hence, they do not celebrate festive or cultural events meaningfully. Another important reason is broken families. People who experienced a tough childhood without a male or female parent are not capable of understanding their own traditions and values. Therefore, they do not grasp the concept of cultural celebrations.
Moreover, there are also cons to this arguments as people just want to take a holiday break. Although people may argue that it is important to remember the intention behind diverse celebrations, others just want to use the day for self-fulfillment purposes. For example, people would organise a party and invite friends over to their house so they can have a good time. Another argument that people only want enjoyment during festive periods is work-stress related illnesses. The majority of middle class workers are hardworking and dedicated to their job. However, the period of time for holiday breaks are significantly short and they just want to use the celebration events to rest at home. Despite the fact that they are neglecting their duties to demonstrate the meaning behind these celebrations to the younger generations, they also have a right to take care of themselves mentally and physically before others.
In conclusion, there are both sides of the argument on why people think others have forgotten the meaning behind event celebrations and why this is not neccesarily true all the time. Personally, I agree that people should always find the meaning behind these celebrations in order to understand themselves better.",,,,,,7.0,"In modern society, it is often believed that the original significance of traditional and religious festivals has faded, with many individuals focusing solely on enjoyment during these times. I tend to agree with this viewpoint, as there are several factors contributing to the decline in cultural awareness. To begin with, the commercialization of festivals has shifted attention towards shopping and entertainment, as seen during Christmas or Diwali when advertisements and sales eclipse spiritual or historical lessons. Furthermore, modern life has become increasingly busy, leaving people with little time or energy to reflect on the meanings behind these occasions. For instance, instead of attending spiritual services or participating in meaningful rituals, many prefer to travel or socialize. Another consideration is that younger generations, influenced by technology and globalization, are often less interested in learning about traditions passed down from older family members. This loss of connection can be observed during cultural holidays, where instead of family discussions about history, people are more likely to share photos on social media. However, it should be acknowledged that some families and communities still make efforts to preserve these traditions. Overall, while there are exceptions, I believe that for the majority, festivals now serve primarily as opportunities for relaxation and pleasure, rather than moments for reflection on their true meanings."
1053,2,"Some people feel that entertainers such as film stars, pop musicians or sports stars are paid too much money.Do you agree or disagree?Which other types of job should be highly paid?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Some people complain that people who work in the entartaining industry such as film stars, pop musicians or sports stars earn excessively huge ammount of money. I agree with that statement, however, I believe that other more essential proffesionals such as doctors, teachers, rescuers should be highly paid.
On the one hand, entertainers earn incredible sum of money which can be estimated much more times than ordinary people obtain. Thier salaries usually allow famous celebrities live very wealthy - they possess expensive properties, laxury cars, have vocations in the best resorts, which a person from another sphere hardly can afford. Of cause, it seems not a matter of the fact that they earn more money than others, but for some people that fact can be observed as unfairness, because the jobs of celebrities are not a rocket of science. However, this is a famous postulate that demand creates supply, that is why demanded professionals have higher earnings than others. For as long as people have possibilities and willingness to make their lives more brighter and interestings, they will pay for entertaining businesses. This is the main reason why entertainers usually wealthy and rich.
On the other hand, some proffesionals such as doctors, teacher, rescuers can be recognised like more important than entertainers, nevertheless they usually underpaid or their earnings can be even so little that it is hard to survive for them. I belive that those people play the more essential roles in the skill development, health improvements and safty of life in general. In my opinion, population should pay more attention to those kinds of proffesions. Additionally, governments should support financially such workers from vitaly important idustries. Moreover, those professionals are usually in demand, by that I mean they should be payed as demanded employees, such as entertainers, no less.
In conclusion, some professionals such as entertainers are paid extremely more money because they are in demand. However, some professionals, such as doctors, teachers, rescuers, usually underpaid. I belive that people as well as government should reconsider the salaries of workers based on their achievements and importance for a society.",,,,,,6.0,"Many people believe that famous entertainers, like movie actors, pop singers, and top athletes, receive far too much money for what they do. I tend to agree with this point of view, as there are many other jobs that have a much greater impact on society but are not equally rewarded. For example, people working in medicine such as doctors and nurses often have the critical responsibility of saving lives, yet many struggle with long hours and comparatively moderate pay. The same can be said for teachers, whose role in educating the next generation is fundamental to any country’s progress, but who rarely receive high salaries. It is true that the entertainment industry generates huge amounts of revenue and that demand for celebrities drives their earnings higher, but when we look at the essential services that truly keep society functioning, it seems unfair to pay entertainers so much more. I believe jobs that require high skill and dedication—like scientists, emergency responders, and teachers—should be paid at least as well as entertainers, because their work is vital to society’s well-being and future. Ultimately, while there will always be a market for entertainment, we should also value and properly compensate those whose work is essential to life and progress."
1055,2,"Some people feel that entertainers such as film stars, pop musicians or sports stars are paid too much money.Do you agree or disagree?Which other types of job should be highly paid?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Nowadays, film stays, pop musicians or sports stars are becoming one of most highest paid jobs. We all at least hread some evidences of this. The big fancy houses, luxury cars or yachts, these are just some of standard equipment. Is this fact good for us? Is this right for our society? Some people rised hot debate on this issue.
Some of them believe this high payment is wrong. They believe those stars or musicians didn't really improve our society too much. They did creat some arts for our spiritual world. However, those contributions are far behind scientists, politicians, doctors and so on. Sadly, we can not live on the songs, the films. Those arts are great, but they aren't great enough to creat a such big payment gap between other jobs. In my country, my teacher, basically a unknown scientist, only has 700 dollars per month. This is incredible low since famous singer have endless zero behind their payment account.
However, the other side of people think their payment is rightful and I am one of them. I don't really love this fact but it's truth because those unbelievable high payment is the result of the our attention to them. In this digital world, attention means money. That is the new rule of our society so there are nothing wrong. As for those scientists or doctors, some of us even can't remeber them before we need them.
So, in my opinion, these payment with uncountable zero are rightful. However, we should rethink of it. Why we spend so much attention on those jods? Why we don't care about other jobs which are means alot for us. That is the thing that we should change.",,,,,,6.5,"These days, it often seems like movie stars, musicians, and famous athletes are earning much more money than people in any other profession, which leads to arguments about whether this is fair. Some people say it is not right for entertainers to be paid so much because their performances are not essential for society to function. For instance, a singer’s music can make us happy, but it does not save lives like a doctor or make discoveries like a scientist. Where I am from, even skilled teachers, who help shape the future of children, usually earn much less in a year than a football player makes in a single match. On the other hand, I can understand why entertainers are paid highly, because millions of people all over the world follow them and want to watch their shows or games, which brings in huge amounts of money. However, I still believe that other professions, such as doctors, scientists, and teachers, deserve higher salaries because they have a much bigger impact on our well-being and the future. For example, during the recent pandemic, it was the doctors and nurses who saved countless lives, while researchers worked non-stop to find vaccines. In my opinion, society should try to reward these important jobs better, even though entertainment is valuable too."

In my opinion, I disagree with this view and believes that they deserved the high salary.
People who works as a movie stars, musicians and sports player deserved high money paid. This is because they advocated all there time and effort to get the salary that they have today. Before they become famous, they only have few incomes or even get nothing. That is to say, many musicians did not get any payment at the begining of their career, so do the actors and sports players, they spent their time but do not get any money. For instance, before being a well-known musicians, they have to spend their own money on buying equipment to produce musics or to public the songs they have made. Also, the creativety and their works cannot be measured by money. Thus, they deserved high salary because of their profession and uncopyable works.
Jobs which needs professional skills and the job envolves high risk shoul also be highly paid. Such as doctors and programmers, their job are unplaceable because these envolved professional knowledge that not everyone had. Moreover, people works in high-risk environment deserved high payment too. For example, fire-fighters, they might got hurt or even die while working. Therefore, higher salary is needed for jobs that need special skills and career with high risk.
To sum up, I agree with the statement because of the reasons above, and jobs with special knowledge and people works in dangerous environment should also be highly paid.",,,,,,5.5,"Many people think that entertainers like movie actors, music artists, or sports champions earn too much money, but I do not fully agree with this opinion. Although their salaries seem huge, usually these jobs come with many challenges and sacrifices. For example, famous athletes have to train for many years and take risks with their health, and singers or movie stars often have to give up privacy and sometimes struggle for a long time before they become successful. There are also only a very few people who manage to reach the top and get paid that much; most entertainers do not earn very high salaries. However, I do think that some other important jobs need to be paid better, like teachers and nurses, because they play a big role in our society by helping people learn and stay healthy. For instance, during the pandemic, many medical workers worked hard to help patients but did not earn as much money as some celebrities. In conclusion, I believe that entertainers are paid for their unique talent and hard work, but jobs that are necessary for the well-being and education of society should also get higher pay."
1059,2,"Some museums and art galleries charge admission fees, while others have free entry.Do you think the advantages of charging for admission outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Should cultural places be charged? This question opens a big debate. On the one hand, there are some museums that require an admission fee to be paid. On the other hand, there are free-entry museums. I believe that if the charge to be paid is not expensive then it is right and fair to require an admission payment to visit a culutural place.
In general, we used to believe that free is always better. However, I believe it is not a waste of money if they are spent to increase your knowledge. In Italy, for instance, museums and cultural places, in general, do not receive the economical support they need from the administrative centres. This phenomenon implies the following choice: either museums have to ask people to pay an entry fee or they have to stop taking care of the building and the artistic works they host. Then, I believe that to pay an admission fee is a way people, who are interested in art and in culture in general, can demonstrate their taking care of the place in which art is preserved.
What should be the negative consequence of asking for an entry fee? In general, we believe that the money we spend is wasted. Although we spend them to obtain something we appreciate a lot, we always have the tendency to think that money should not be used and preserved. I cannot disagree with this way of thinking. However, I believe that spending money to pay a trisfling amount of money to get access to a cultural place is not a waste. Rather, it is a sort of investment for your personal culture and for the cultural building itself. What's more, generally, if people have to spend money to do any activity they used to enjoy as they can. As good materialists, we want to live the experience to respect the money spent. Then, paying an entry fee will encourage people who care about art to visit a museum rather than those who do not care. Art maybe is made less accessible but, in my opinion, will be more respected. The entry fee should not be (and in general is not) expensive. I cannot see why it should be seen as a loss of money to pay the entry fee of 5 euros to go inside the Louvre in Paris, the estraordinary Valle dei Templi in Sicily, or the magnificent Uffizi gallery in Florence. I believe that money could not be spent in a better way than to visit these places.
In conclusion, I believe there are no real disadvantages caused by the payment of an entry fee, rather there are economic advantages that could help the administration of the museums in maintaining the quality of the service and preserving art works.",,,,,,7.0,"The question of whether museums and art galleries should charge admission fees is a complex one, with valid points on both sides. Some argue that culture and history should be accessible to everyone, regardless of financial status, so that all can learn and be inspired by the treasures these places hold. However, looking at the reality, I think that charging a reasonable admission fee brings more advantages than disadvantages, especially when considering how museums operate. For example, many museums in my country struggle to maintain their exhibits and provide new programs because they do not receive enough government funding. When there is no entry fee, museums often have to rely on donations, which can be unreliable and inadequate for large expenses like restoring paintings or updating displays. Charging visitors for admission means museums have a more stable income, which can be used to protect valuable artifacts and create educational events for both children and adults. Of course, the main drawback is that some people might not be able to afford the fee, but many museums offer discounts for students, seniors, and families, or free entry days throughout the year so everyone still has a chance to visit. From my own experience visiting museums in different countries, I have noticed that even a small admission fee makes visitors more respectful of the space and the art. In summary, while free entry helps make culture more accessible, I believe that asking for a moderate admission charge is reasonable and ultimately benefits both the museums themselves and their visitors in the long run."

I fully think that the benefits to have admission fees compensate the drawbacks to be not free.
Many individuals would visit museum or art galleries if it were free which could attract more tourists. Unfortunately, admission charge decreases the possibility to discover paintings or masterpieces. However, before being a cultural place, art galleries are a place where numerous employees work. Indeed, if visitors had not to purchase the entrance, workforce would be not paid and the place would be not clean as museum should be. Moreover, huge museums as the British Museum have some sponsors to restore masterpieces whereas small museums have sometimes not the fundings and hence, admission fees would help it. Then, having an entry fee limit the number of individuals who do not really want to see art and appreciate the place.
Concerning to cultural places, museum and art galleries know that many households could not afford ticket entrances for their offspring so many museums establish reduced price for teenagers and children. This project improves the relation between young people and the culture, then it allows children to be attracted to culture, partipate to the technical expenses behind the entry fee and after to visit again some cultural places when they will grow up and purchase the full price. Moreover, purchasing tickets help to the economy of the country which sometimes famous cultural places are a significant part of country's income. For instance, admission fees in museum are two third of the tourism's outcome in France.
To conclude, I believe that admission fees should outweigh free entrance because it does not let the worth process of museum to work. Even if sometimes admission fees are costly for us, there is always a meaning behind the prices.",,,,,,6.0,"There are some museums and art galleries that require visitors to pay for admission, while others remain free to the public. In my view, I believe that the advantages of charging an entry fee are greater than the drawbacks. Admittedly, if admission were always free, more people—including those from low-income backgrounds—would have the chance to view and appreciate art and history. This might enhance the spread of culture and attract larger crowds. Nevertheless, museums and art galleries need funds for activities such as maintenance, restoration of artworks, and payment of staff salaries. Without entry fees, many smaller institutions might struggle to survive, especially if they lack substantial government support or private sponsorships. Charging for tickets can also help museums limit overcrowding and create a quieter, more respectful space for visitors to enjoy the exhibitions. In order to make culture accessible for younger generations, many places offer discounted or free tickets for children and students, which broadens access while still securing some income. For example, the Louvre in Paris funds a significant portion of its operations through ticket sales, which helps maintain its world-class collections. Therefore, even though free entry has clear benefits, I think admission fees are essential for the sustainability and quality of museums and galleries."
1063,2,"Some museums and art galleries charge admission fees, while others have free entry.Do you think the advantages of charging for admission outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Most world-class museums are free in London, but some museums and art galleries around the world have an admission charges. Frankly speaking, museums with free entry do not mean no cost incurred in their operation. In contrary, there is a lot of maintenance expenditure on exhibits of museums, particularly on historical paintings and valuable statues. These costs are funded by the governments in order to provide the welfare to their civilians. Some people advocate all museums and art galleries should charge the entrance fees as the public funding have to be spent in dire need of foods and housing in the community. This essay attempts to find out its benefits against costs.
There is no doubt that thousand millions expenditure in the operating of museums are financed by the local governments. The UK government reportedly spends almost 500 million pounds a year on supporting the cultural and artistic life of the country. Some people object to this expenditure, arguing that it is unfair to devote much tax payers' money to things which only appeal to a minority of people. They think these attractions should be self-funding, in other words, museums and galleries should set an entrance fee which cover their costs, besides, these costs are reflected via a realistic amount for tickets. The public funds saved could then be spent on more important matters such as housing or providing better educational facilities.
Nevertheless, the culture and arts are not a trivial matter but a vital part of a nation's identity. Not only the arts have a key educational role by representing the traditions and heritage of people, but also galleries and museums should be freely available to all, rich or poor. It is clear that this is basic welfare to all citizens in a country. From economic aspects, tourism can be drived by these attractions. A case in point is British museum, which appeals an endless influx of tourists from various parts of the world to visit every year. Therefore, they are responsible for a significant amount of employment.
My take on this is that the governments have a responsibility to support a range of cultural and artistic activities and to make the museums and galleries free available to all their civilians despite many demanding on their funding resources in the community.",,,,,,6.5,"Many museums and art galleries around the world ask visitors to pay an entrance fee, while others allow free access to their collections. There are clear benefits to charging admission, such as generating essential funds for maintenance, security, and the preservation of priceless artifacts. Entrance fees also help limit overcrowding and can ensure that only genuinely interested people visit, which can provide a better overall experience. For example, when I visited a popular science museum that charged a small fee, the exhibitions were well-maintained and staff were available to offer informative tours, which greatly enhanced my visit. On the other hand, charging admission can turn museums and galleries into exclusive spaces, making it harder for people from less privileged backgrounds, particularly students and families, to access the same cultural and educational opportunities as others. This could lead to a loss in public engagement and limit the museum's role in spreading knowledge and appreciation for the arts. Free museums, like those in many European cities, seem to attract more diverse visitors and play a crucial role in both tourism and community engagement. Overall, while admission charges may help maintain the high quality of displays and facilities, I believe the drawbacks—particularly the exclusion of certain groups from cultural experiences—outweigh the advantages. Therefore, museums should strive to remain accessible to everyone, using public funds or alternative revenue streams to support their operations."

On the one hand, there is a necessity to invade some admission fees, because a public institution can't survive without financial support.

Supporters of admission fees argue that charging visitors is essential for the upkeep of these cultural sites. The money collected from tickets can be spent on maintaining the building, conserving artwork, and organizing special exhibitions that may draw in more visitors. For example, I have seen some local museums use their funds to create interactive displays and educational workshops, which greatly benefit the community. However, charging for entry may discourage people, especially students and low-income individuals, from accessing art and culture. In contrast, when museums are free, this allows everyone the chance to enjoy and learn, regardless of their financial situation. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, have adopted a policy of free admission at national museums, making culture widely accessible. Overall, although charging for entrance helps with finances and quality, it can limit inclusivity. Therefore, I believe the disadvantages of charging admission often outweigh the advantages, as making culture available to everyone should be the top priority."

Charging visitors for admission can provide crucial funds that help maintain the quality of exhibits, keep the facilities in good condition, and support educational programs. For instance, some renowned museums rely heavily on ticket sales to preserve rare artifacts, hire knowledgeable guides, and develop interactive displays that enhance the learning experience for guests. Additionally, paid entry can encourage people to value their visit more, making them less likely to treat the space carelessly. On the downside, entrance fees can create a barrier for those who are less financially stable, possibly discouraging families and students from enjoying cultural experiences and learning opportunities. Free entry, on the other hand, makes museums and galleries accessible to everyone, which may foster a greater appreciation of art and history across society. However, without sufficient funding, free museums might struggle to refresh their collections or provide a high level of service. In my opinion, although charging admission supports the sustainability and development of these institutions, it is also important to ensure that everyone has access to culture. Therefore, a balanced solution like free entry days or concessions for certain groups could combine the best aspects of both approaches."

However, some places are charging the admission fee for entry, while others are free.
I strongly agree that the advantages of this charge outweigh the disadvantages. In this essay, I will demonstrate by using examples of the funding management of Museum Siam and the charging rate of museums and art galleries in Thailand.
On the one hand, there is ample evidence that the admission charge for entry exhibitions is used for fixing and improving facilities. For example, Museum Siam in Thailand exhibiting in the old buildings in Bangkok city manages the admission fees for fixing the building and for caring toilet and parking facilities. However, this fee is just a small part of managing funds as the museum is supported by the Thai government, which responses to minister expenses.
On the other hand, some museums and art galleries in Thailand are free for Thais only, while the foreigners have to pay for entry. Since the exhibitions are fully taken care from governments for facilitating the visitors, this brings to a benefit for Thai citizens to explore the exhibitions without any loss of their money. Also, the exhibition aims to promote for foreigners rather than domestic people, leading to the charge rising to double of the normal price when high season.
In conclusion, I believe that the admission fees are significant for supporting the museum administrations in order to take care of and fix the facilities. Also, it seems like exchanging systems, if you want to gain extraordinary experiences and fulfill your passions, you have to pay for it.",,,,,,7.0,"Museums and art galleries are important places for people to learn about history, culture, and art. Some of these places require visitors to pay an entrance fee, while others allow anyone to enter for free. In my opinion, charging admission fees has more advantages than disadvantages. One main reason is that the money collected from ticket sales helps museums maintain their collections and improve services for visitors. For instance, the National Museum in my city uses the funds from tickets to restore old paintings and buy new pieces of art for everyone to enjoy. Moreover, by having an entrance fee, museums can control the number of visitors, making it less crowded and more enjoyable for people who truly appreciate the exhibits. On the downside, admission fees can prevent some people, especially students or low-income families, from entering, which may limit access to education and culture. However, many places offer free entry on certain days or discounts for locals, which helps solve this problem. All things considered, although there are some disadvantages, I believe that the benefits of charging admission fees, like sustaining and improving museums, are greater than the drawbacks."
1071,2,Some people feel that the design of newly constructed buildings in big cities should be controlled by governments. Others believe those who finance the construction of a building should be free to design it as they see fit.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Something that has been debated about a lot recently, people around the world have different views about to whom the design of newly constructed buildings should be controlled by. Today, I am here to discuss both sides of the matter and at the end will give my own view.
The people who believe the design of these buildings should be controlled by governments believe so, because they feel that the governments will design the buildings in a way that is not too flashy and nor to minimalistic. It has been seen may times that buildings built by constructing companies/ the financers turn out to be either very flashy or minimalistic. A great example of this is in India's capital, Delhi, where an originally planned office, had exteriors constructed in a very childish and jazzy manner. A thing to also keep in mind that this was the construction of a private office for the top lawyer in Delhi, Arun Deshmukh. He handed over the design of his office to the constructors feeling they won't do anything immature. 4 years later, however, when he went to see the final result of his much-awaited private office, he was completey bewildered by the sight. Instead of seeing a normal office-like building with normal cement on it's exterior, he saw that his dream office looked the exterior of a night club! Instead of normal cement, the exterior was built with transparent glass, and Mr. Deshmukh's name and designation, written in a florescent like way, was carved out on a 3 metre long glass slab!!
Coming to the people who believe the control of the design should go to the constructors/people who finance the building think so because they feel that not everything should be in the hands of the government. They also feel that since it was their initiative to get that building built, they should have the final say on how it should look like.
When it comes to my opinion, i believe that the control of the design of the building should go to the person/people who first thought of getting it constructed, meaning the people hired architects and did the needful to get an ideal design of the building they want to construct.",,,,,,6.5,"One topic that has been widely discussed is whether the government should control the design of new buildings in large cities, or if the people providing the funds should have total freedom in deciding what the buildings look like. On one side, those in favor of government control argue that the appearance of buildings can have a big effect on the city's overall image, public safety, and urban planning. For example, in places like Paris, strict regulations have preserved historical charm and made sure that new buildings blend well with their surroundings. Supporters believe this prevents odd, mismatched, or even dangerous designs that could make the city less appealing or even more difficult to navigate. On the other hand, many people feel that if someone is investing a lot of money into building something, they should have the right to express their own taste and creativity. They argue that unique and diverse architecture can actually attract more interest to the city, as was the case with the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, which transformed the city’s reputation due to its bold design by a private financier. Personally, I think there needs to be a combination of both: governments should set basic guidelines to maintain safety and harmony, but investors should have enough freedom to create new and interesting buildings within those limits. This balance would both protect the character of a city and encourage architectural innovation."

Others believe those who finance the construction of a building should be free to design it as they see fit.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is often argued that governments should involve in construction's design in huge cities, while others argued that governments do not have to retrict the free of designers' imagination if those designs are splendid fit on the cities. I believe that if that were to happen, it would be the positive development. This essay will highlight the both views and give personal opinion from the former argument's side.
To begin with latter opinion, although governments have worried about the combination of buildings entirely, the strong limitation about design can cause squandering of designers' skills. There are huge number of competitions about designing building in this society, and the evolution in these fields has developed dramatically. However, if there is a strict criteria on design of building, the majority of intelligences do not need to hammer away to come up with revolutional outline for building.
On the other hand, signitured design of the big cities by itself can be the purpose of trevelling as a landmark, and it can be followed by significant economical achievement in the country. To take myself as an example, in 2017, I went to Gold Coast for study automotive engineering, and I was stunnied becaused of the atmosphere which is formed by combination of similar buildings and beach. Furthermore, according to the research from Sydney university, Gold Coast is one of the cities which make a fortune because of marvelous view.
To sum up with, I would therefore argue that in spite of the fact that building design restriction can influence on architects negatively, it has a potential ability to make a significant profit in the future.",,,,,,6.0,"There are differing opinions regarding whether the government should have control over the design of new buildings in large cities or if this authority should lie entirely with the investors. On one side, those supporting government intervention argue that uniformity and aesthetic harmony are important for city identity and can help attract more tourists and boost civic pride. For instance, cities like Paris and Singapore are celebrated for their cohesive architectural styles, which government regulation has helped to preserve. Conversely, critics of regulation believe that allowing financiers and architects to have creative freedom encourages innovation and the construction of unique buildings that may become future icons. Restricting this creativity, they argue, could limit technological advancement and personal expression in urban development. In my view, a balanced approach is needed, where the government sets broad guidelines for safety and overall city appearance, but architects and investors still have enough freedom to innovate. This way, cities maintain their distinct character while still embracing fresh and original ideas in their skylines."

In my opinion, the government should allow the construction industry without so much scrutiny.
Nowadays, many modern architectural buildings have been constructed in big cities such as IT companies, apartments, shopping malls, and many more, making our city very attractive. The private construction industry can only invest a massive amount in the structure, and it will not only look good but also boost our country's economy. To exemplify, Dubai is famous for its different architectural buildings, such as Burj Khalifa, the tallest building globally, the Dubai frame, and many more.
Although it looks nice and pleasant for us to see the city with new buildings, the construction industry should abide by the law while constructing. It should not cause any damage to the people around the building; however, the skyscrapers are a great hindrance for flights. For example, a major human-made disaster happened a decade ago. The pilot who flew passenger's flight could not fly properly, as there were many skyscrapers near the airport, which led to an air crash, and many people died in the accident. It is one of the reasons some people think that government should control the building structures.

Some argue that government control is crucial to ensure that cities maintain an organized appearance and adhere to safety, historical, and environmental standards.

On the other hand, there are those who believe that investors should have the freedom to design buildings according to their vision, since they are the ones risking their funds and are more likely to develop innovative and unique structures. This approach can lead to creative skyscrapers and impressive landmarks, such as the Shard in London, which was only made possible because of investor-driven design. Personally, I feel that a balance is necessary—while the government should set basic rules to protect public interests, investors also deserve some creative freedom to design extraordinary structures that can enhance a city’s character."

From my perspective, it is essential for governments to play a role in regulating building designs, though not to the extent of completely stifling creativity. On the one hand, when investors are given complete freedom, it can lead to innovative and iconic structures that attract tourism and contribute to a city’s unique identity, as seen with landmarks like the Sydney Opera House or the Shard in London. However, on the other hand, if left unchecked, such freedom might result in poorly planned or mismatched buildings that negatively impact city scenery, block public spaces, or cause practical issues like increased traffic congestion. For instance, in some cities, the lack of coherent planning has led to overcrowded streets and loss of cultural heritage sites. Therefore, I believe that while financial backers should have room for creativity and expression, governments should set reasonable guidelines to ensure new buildings fit within the overall plan and character of the city, guaranteeing the safety, functionality, and aesthetic value for the community as a whole."
1079,2,Some people think that there should be strict laws to control the amount of noise a person makes because of the disturbance it causes to people.Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"As population grows and society expands, noise pollution inevitably occurs more often and worse. This concept triggered some people to start thinking that there oughts to be strict regulations on how much noise each individual can make in order to minimise the harmful effect on other people. In this essay, I will discuss both advantages and disadvantages of the regulations and suggest whether it is beneficial or not after all.
One of the advantages if strict laws are applied is that it is the easiest and most effective way of solving the problem in a short term. The noise level of human population will significantly drop as being loud becomes an illegal action to carry out. For instacne, even imposing a fine due to excessive sound one made can strongly discourage him or her from making loud noises ever again. Furthermore, people's standard of living will most likely to be enhanced as there are less disturbance caused by noise. People will be able to enjoy quiet, relaxing weekends even in central cities, for example.
In contrast to the preceding positive outcomes, there are disadvantages due to the strict laws such as too much restrictions on people. The laws can be considered as rather aggressive and coercive since people's some daily life routines may get spoiled. Some hobbies like singing and even special cases like emergency situations will confront some problems if such laws become real. Moreover, it is almost impractical to set up the standard of 'loud' noise or even measuring the decibels individulas make all the time. Society would get rather intensive and monotonous once the laws controlling the sound level are implemented.
In summary, despite the efficient aspects of the laws, it is more important to acknowledge the negative sides such as stress individuals suffer from strict regulations or damages on their lifestyle. Noise pollution should be resolved through more friendly means like advertisement rather than inflexible laws.",,,,,,6.0,"The idea of introducing strict laws to control noise levels is often debated, as noise pollution has become a significant problem in many urban and residential areas. On the one hand, having clear regulations can help to reduce unwanted disturbances, especially in densely populated neighborhoods where one person’s loud behavior can negatively impact many others. For example, quiet hours enforced in apartment buildings discourage late-night parties, making it easier for residents to sleep. Moreover, reducing excessive noise can benefit public health, as constant loud environments have been linked to stress and even hearing issues. However, there are also clear disadvantages to such strict laws. Over-regulating noise might interfere with people’s basic freedoms and everyday routines, making it hard to celebrate events or practice musical instruments. Additionally, enforcing noise rules can be difficult, as what some people consider disruptive might not bother others, and measuring noise consistently is complicated. In my experience, occasional loud celebrations after an important sporting match or during festivals do bring people together and add vibrancy to community life, so banning them altogether could lead to a dull and more isolated society. In conclusion, while strict noise control laws can protect people from constant disturbance, they may also unnecessarily limit individual expression and joy, so a balanced approach with guidelines and education might work better than rigid enforcement."

Noise pollution affects different groups of people in various ways.The increasing noise in recent days has led to increasing problems of hearing impairment in people in today's society.Also,the noise pollution has a devastating affects on the heart patients and it has been affecting people who are working and studying in various ways.By implementing strict rules like imposing heavy fines on vehicles honking unnecessarily and filing a case on the noise caused by the public gatherings like rallies,the above problems can be addressed.For example, recent studies have shown that the cities having less noise pollution have been leading better life when compared to those with noise pollution.
However,implementing strict laws on noise caused by a person also has some disadvantages.Firstly,different religions have different kinds of festivals which cause a lot of noise.For instance,diwali,one of the most celebrated festivals in India,is celebrated by firing crackers causing a lot of noise is affected by implementing these laws.Secondly,most of the people with religious beliefs will have a bad impact by these rules.To give an example,the prayers in masjids are made with loud noise so that it can reach a large group of people living in the area.
To conclude,implemeting strict rules like fines and filing a case on the people causing noise pollution have a good impact on the health of the society and increasing the efficiency of work where as the festivals and the religious centres have a negative impact by these laws.",,,,,,8.0,"Noise pollution is an issue that has become more prominent as cities grow and more people live close together. Strict laws to control noise can offer some clear advantages. Firstly, reducing noise through regulations helps protect public health, since too much noise can cause stress or even damage to people’s hearing over time. Limiting loud activities, such as construction work during nighttime hours or setting maximum volume limits for events, ensures everyone can enjoy a more peaceful living environment. These steps can also improve people’s ability to concentrate at school or work. However, having very strict laws about noise can cause some problems in society as well. In many cultures, celebrations and festivals are often noisy, such as street parades or family gatherings, and these are important ways for people to express their traditions. For example, during New Year’s celebrations, people often set off fireworks, creating loud sounds that may be forbidden under tougher rules. This could make people feel their customs are not respected. Strict noise laws might also impact businesses, like restaurants or musicians who rely on lively atmospheres to attract customers. In conclusion, while controlling noise with stricter laws can improve health and comfort in cities, it is important to consider exceptions for cultural and social activities so that the laws do not negatively affect traditions or businesses."

This issue has raised some concern whether proper legislations must be implemented or not. In this essay, the positive side as well as the drawbacks of noise will be discussed and the reason why I think that it is better for our leaders to take action regarding this matter will be explained.
Noise can give the community awareness and enjoyment. Noise can help people know what is going on in their area. For example, during thee COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, it is mandatory for the local government to sound sirens and alarms for the city to know that the curfew has began, leading to people's awareness that they should be at their homes in time. In terms of enjoyment, a substantial amount of noise can make one enjoy his free time, such that his leisure activity is related to music. Instrumentalists need time to practice their skills for them to excel in this field. If laws regarding to noise will be implemented, their practice will be controlled in such a way that this will not be available on their ends.
On the other hand, one considers noise as a pollution that can cause detrimental effects in the society, resulting for an aim to reduce it by the help of the government. Noise can give a person distractions not only in his rest, but also in his work. Work form home is becoming ubiquitous nowadays. Once noise is uncontrolled, there is a tendency that distractions occur, which cause poor career performance. Also, sufficient rest is an essential commodity for the body and brain to recharge after long shifts of work. Noise can hinder one to attain this, leading to health problems, such as brain and physical fatigue. Hence, laws must be implemented by the authority to prevent the drawbacks that it can bring to an individual.
In conclusion, noise is beneficial to some for it brings an increase in awareness and enjoyment in leisure activities, however, one ought to consider the health risks it inflicts and its negative effects to one's work performance. In my view, the government must strictly prohibit noise pollution and that legislations must be firmly established to prevent the drawbacks it can make.",,,,,,7.5,"Noise pollution has become a major issue in many communities, prompting some people to call for stricter regulations to limit the amount of noise individuals can create. On the positive side, some level of noise is a natural part of life and can actually foster a lively atmosphere in neighborhoods, such as when children are playing outside or when people celebrate festivals and local events. These sounds can make places feel more vibrant and connected. For example, during traditional celebrations in my town, music and laughter bring everyone together, creating a sense of unity. However, too much noise can seriously interfere with daily life, especially for those who need peace to sleep, concentrate on work, or recover from illness. Excessive noise has even been linked to increased stress and poor health outcomes. Many people who work from home, including myself, have found that uncontrolled noise can make it almost impossible to focus, leading to frustration and decreased productivity. Strict laws could help reduce these problems by setting limits during night hours or near hospitals, but they might also limit people’s freedom to express themselves or enjoy social activities. In conclusion, although strict regulations on noise could significantly improve public wellbeing by reducing distraction and health risks, care must be taken to balance these measures with the positive aspects of community life to ensure that everyone’s needs are respected."

However, there are also disadvantages, such as limiting personal freedom and enjoyment in situations like celebrations, weddings, or festivals where people like to play music or use firecrackers to express happiness. For example, during my cousin’s wedding, the neighborhood enjoyed the lively drumming and songs, which brought everyone together, but loud restrictions could have stopped that joyful moment. But on the other hand, I have experienced sleepless nights when neighbors played loud music late, which made me tired and unfocused the next day.

On the one hand, the noise may influence the humans' nervous system in a negative way. It can be observed that it is common situation when a person has a headache after spending long hours in buzzy place. Additionally, this problem can be treated as an ethical issue as there are some people who are highly affected by noise and it is crucial to respect people's comfort and not to make things that may cause the disturbance of some citizens. for example, noise can make babies asleep, thus making them worried and influencing their health and day timetable.
On the other hand, should the restrictions regarding the rate of sound be made, a lot of controversial issues will appear. Firstly, it is very hard to establish what rate of noise influence badly on peopleit as the opinions may differ. Secondly, it can be argued if restrictions are coherent or they are contradicts the right of autonomy of every resident. For instance, elderly people might be influenced by the little noise, while the majority of people do not find this rate of sound high. At the same time, it is a nature of children to make some noise while playing and forbidding this might lead to bad state of mind of children.

These rules would also benefit vulnerable groups such as elderly people, young children, or those working from home, by ensuring their environment is peaceful. However, there are several disadvantages to consider. Enforcing specific noise limits can be difficult and may lead to arguments over what is acceptable, as different individuals have different levels of tolerance. Some people might feel that strict regulations limit their personal freedom, for instance, when celebrating festivals or hosting gatherings. Additionally, in cases like construction work or emergency repairs, some noise is unavoidable, and overly strict laws might make life unnecessarily complicated.

On the other hand, should the restrictions regarding the rate of sound be made, a lot of controversial issues will appear. Firstly, it is very hard to establish what rate of noise influence badly on peopleit as the opinions may differ. Secondly, it can be argued if restrictions are coherent or they are contradicts the right of autonomy of every resident. For instance, elderly people might be influenced by the little noise, while the majority of people do not find this rate of sound high. At the same time, it is a nature of children to make some noise while playing and forbidding this might lead to bad state of mind of children.
Ultimately, the concept of making some measurements on the noise has some advantages and drawbacks. From the one point it is effective way of prevention people being irritated by noise. From the other point, the notion of limited rate of noise is very controversial, and is unlikely to work efficiently.",,,,,,7.0,"There is a debate about whether implementing strict laws to reduce noise levels is necessary due to the inconvenience and distress loud noises can bring. On one side, establishing strict regulations could help create more peaceful neighborhoods, leading to improved concentration for students, better sleep for families, and calm environments for those with health conditions sensitive to sound. For instance, people living near construction sites or busy roads often report higher stress levels because of constant disturbance from excessive noise, showing the importance of controlling loud sounds. However, strict rules on noise also have potential drawbacks. It can be difficult to agree on acceptable noise limits, as tolerance varies from person to person; what might seem loud to one individual could be normal for another. Furthermore, such regulations might restrict people's freedom during celebrations, gatherings, or simple activities like children playing outdoors. In conclusion, even though strict noise control laws may benefit those who seek tranquility, these rules might also cause arguments and limit personal freedoms, indicating that careful consideration is required before introducing such restrictions."
1091,2,Some people think that there should be strict laws to control the amount of noise a person makes because of the disturbance it causes to people.Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Recently, there have been several laws to control the noise made by neighbors and surrounded places close to people's accommodations. Some people think that these laws should be strict and effectively enforced by authorities in order to avoid any small noise that might disturb the private comfortability. Others believe that such laws might entail a few disadvantages and negative repercussions on people's lives. In this essay I will be trying to count possible advantages and disadvantages of this legislation.
It is well known that home is the ideal place to rest, relax and bring positive energies to the residents. Thus, noise made by the neighbors might threat these unique blessings we are used to enjoying in our houses. Moreover, many people perform vital actions within their homes that require silence and high concentration, such as studying, reading and other forms of creative activities. Therefore, governments' duty is to guarantee that these activities are performed without any disturbance, by making specific laws to control the amount of noise and ensure optimal quality of life for all the citizens. In addition, if there were not laws to control the noise, we would encounter many more fights and inconvenient incidents among neighbors.
On the other hand, there is another aspect to be considered. Calling for strict laws and total preventing of any sounds produced by adjacent people could sounds unacceptable. People still have the basic right to arrange meetings and parties at their homes, and others need to listen to music as a vital action for their soul and wellbeing.
To conclude, in order to find the balance between the advantages and the disadvantages, governments might design flexible laws to meet the people's needs. For example, in some cities, noise preventing is valid only in specific periods of the day, periods in which most of the people supposed to rest and need silence.",,,,,,7.0,"There is ongoing debate about whether strict noise control laws are necessary to protect people from unnecessary disturbance. On the one hand, enacting such legislation offers clear advantages, as excessive noise can negatively affect quality of life, disrupt sleep, and reduce productivity, especially for students or remote workers who need a quiet environment. Furthermore, vulnerable groups such as young children, the elderly, and patients recovering from illness particularly benefit from a peaceful atmosphere. Clear and enforceable noise limits can help prevent conflicts among neighbors, which could otherwise escalate and create tension within communities. However, there are also disadvantages to imposing strict noise regulations. For one, people could feel restricted in their ability to celebrate occasions, host gatherings, or enjoy music, all of which are important cultural and social activities. Sometimes noise is inevitable, such as during home renovations or city celebrations, and excessively rigid laws could make it difficult for people to live freely or cause resentment towards authorities. A balanced solution may be preferable, such as setting quiet hours during the night while permitting reasonable levels of noise during the day, as is done in some cities. In the end, while it is important to minimize unnecessary disturbance, laws must also respect individuals' right to enjoy their homes and social lives."
1093,2,A country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"There are people who believe that the mixture of nationalities make faster the development of a country. Although, it could seem that an international environment could influence negatively the culture of a country, I believe that the exchange that is born from people coming from different places is essential in order to develop the social attitudes of the citiziens and to have new ideas and perspectives.
The internationality of a country permits people to develop their social attitudes. To live in the same country with people who have originated in a different one require all of them to be open to discover now personal outlooks. They have to communicate between each other and also to respect the different cultural habits they have. This lead people to be more open-minded and ready to accept new changes. A country in which there are these features will develop from different point of view faster. Indeed, people will be already able to understand the flow of the new trends and they will be open to new economical and political choices. By contrast, in a country in which there is no way to interact with people who have a different nationality will be more difficult to understand the limit and the possibilities of their country. Although the tradition of the country will be preserved, people will be less accostumated to the change trying to mantain their traditional custums, even if uncorrect, as soon as they can. The political and economical assestment of these country will reflect the closeness of the population. For instance, they will be less concerned about the stability of the other countries and they will try to develop their own without caring of the international consequences.
Furthermore, a country in which there are different people who comes from different places is one in which new ideas and perspectives can be develped. Indeed, workplaces will be encouraged in their development by the interaction between people who have different culture. In the general picture, the benefit of each single and small company will impact positively on the country itself and its economical status. To go further, people who have to interact with other foreign nationalities will be able to communicate with them and this means that they will be able to speak and understand other languages other than their mother tongue. The ability to be fluently in other languages, mostly in English, nowadays is essential for the develop of a country. The companies will be able to expand their trade.
In conclusion, I completely agree with the idea that a country can develop faster its population is made of different nationalities. There will be advantages from the social and cultural perspective as well as from the economical and political point of view.",,,,,,6.5,"Some people think that having a population with many nationalities can help a country become more interesting and develop at a faster rate. I agree with this idea because when people from different backgrounds live together, they bring many new thoughts and traditions. This can help everyone become more tolerant and open to new things, which can change the society in a good way. For example, when I look at my own country, I have noticed that cities where people speak different languages and celebrate diverse festivals are more lively and creative. In addition, workers coming from other countries often bring useful skills that are not always found locally, making businesses stronger and more competitive. Although some people worry that too much diversity might harm national traditions, I think new customs can actually help them change in positive ways, as communities share dishes, music, and art with each other. In my experience, countries that combine many nationalities can grow faster both in society and in the economy, because they are able to accept new ideas and quickly adapt to changes in the world. Therefore, I think having a mix of nationalities is important for a country to be more interesting and to develop faster."
1095,2,A country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is belived that countries are developing faster and become more inspiring when their populations consist of variety of people with different nationalities. In my opinion, it is very controversial question, but I believe that nations who are tolerant to others and friendly are able to succeed in constracting better world not only for themselves and their surroundings but also for future generations. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view about attractiveness and development of countries based on national diversity.
On the one hand, people of different nationalities are hardly able to understand each other and can be impatient for people who have another nationalities, that can create difficulties in communication, making agreements, sovling of problems. For example, people with different backgrounds can strat arguing about better governmental constitutions and politics, religions, educational system, traditional and another types of medicine, and so on. It worths to mention that none of those people will be completely right, if they deside to show off their experience instead of accepting ideas of others and just giving advice. Moreover, some disputes can even lead to quarrels, but not to finding the better dessisions, that can influence on safety of people with different nationalities. So, for living peacefully and sharing some ideas of better developmental practice, people should first of all respect each other independantly of their nantionalities.
On the other hand, people of various nationalities are able to create not only interesting and diverse community, but also share knowlege and experience in order to achieve the best results in countries' development. For achieving this, people should follow several basic rules, which are usually unwritten, but those mental and behavioral lows should be understood by everyone. Firstly, they should be tolerant to each other and accepting some differences. Secondly, they should be polite when they want to share their knowlege and experiences, not showing off. Thirdly, it would be wonderful if they are able to create international community where people can communicate and make friends. Last but not least, they should remember that their attitudes for each other influence on the world as a whole where they and their children live, so they should be responsible for their words and behavior.
In conclusion, countries which managed to connect people of different nationalities and create a friendly surroundings, in my opinion, are able to develope faster and look like fascinating diverse community which consist of people of various backgrounds.",,,,,,6.0,"It is often debated whether having a mix of nationalities within a country's population makes it more interesting and helps it develop at a faster rate. Personally, I believe that a diverse population brings significant advantages in both areas, although there can be challenges as well. On the positive side, people from different national backgrounds introduce a wide variety of traditions, cuisines, and viewpoints, which can make a country far more lively and appealing not only for locals but also for tourists. Additionally, when individuals from various cultures work together, they often bring new skills and ideas, which can lead to innovation and better solutions for common problems; for example, cities like Toronto and Singapore have benefited greatly in terms of economic growth and creativity due to their multicultural societies. However, it is also important to recognize that a blend of nationalities can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or conflicts, especially if people are not open-minded or tolerant of each other’s traditions. Despite these potential difficulties, I think the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, provided that respect and cooperation are encouraged. In conclusion, a country with inhabitants from different backgrounds is generally more interesting and develops more rapidly, as long as there is a strong commitment to inclusiveness and mutual respect."
1097,2,A country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"A nation becomes more interesting and advance faster when the population contains a blended numbers of nationalities. This essay completely agrees with this statement, because this will lead every ethnic group to reflect their lifestyles , and also boost the tourism industry.
On the one hand, When every ethnic group reflects the society they belong to it. This will helps in creating postive representation of the society as they will learn about each others through several ways , like food, clothes and traditions. For example, a survey conducted by the minstry of tourism in Egypt showed around 90 percent of people agreed that this will helps to fill the gap of cultural differences, as it will facilitates communication across nations and enhance confidence and trust between both cultures.
On the other hand, tourism industry will benefit when the population is blended. This is because, alot of tourists will be attracted to that foreign destination. So, this will boost the economy of the nation as growing numbers of jobs will be available.As as result, unemployment rate will decrease. For Instance, Australia benefited from the tourism industry especially in areas like Queensland and Sydney, where a large number of vacant jobs is available which resulted in growing economy.
In conclusion , a society contains a mixture of nationalities will helps it to grow culturally and economically. As every ethinic group will learn about each others, it will also benefit the economy, as a result more jobs will be available and unemployment rate will decrease.",,,,,,7.0,"Countries with diverse populations are often more dynamic and develop at a faster pace, and I fully agree with this opinion for several reasons. Firstly, a mixture of nationalities can help to create a more vibrant and creative culture, as people from different backgrounds bring their own customs, traditions, and ideas, which can encourage innovation in art, cuisine, and even technology. For instance, in cities like Toronto and London, the presence of many immigrant communities has resulted in a rich variety of restaurants and cultural festivals that attract locals and visitors alike. Secondly, having a blend of nationalities can improve the workforce by introducing new skills and perspectives, making companies more competitive in the global market. An example is the United States’ Silicon Valley, where talented people from all over the world come to work, resulting in rapid technological progress. Finally, countries with diverse populations tend to be more open and attractive to international tourists, which helps boost the tourism sector and the economy as a whole. For example, multicultural Singapore is famous for its blend of Asian and Western influences, drawing millions of tourists every year. In conclusion, I believe that when a country's population is made up of different nationalities, it not only becomes more interesting for residents and visitors but also develops more quickly through cultural enrichment and economic opportunities."
1099,2,A country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Some people believe that having a population with a mixture of nationalities makes countries more interesting and helps them to develop faster. In my opinion, people from different nationalities have their own points of view, therefore each of them provide different perspectives to make a country more developed.
People who lives in a country with one nationality generally do not want other people from different countries to migrate their countries. The reason for this kind of thought is about safety of their countries. Moreover, they do not want to employ people who migrated. Therefore, these countries become more and more isolated from other ones. In this globalization area, a country which has just a one way of thinking, do not have oppurtinity to develop and becoma a interest to different nationalities.
On the other hand countries with multinational populations have mixture of cultures. Each of the people provides a different tradition of their own nationality. These traditions may become a way of entertainment to attract tourists. Due to the tourism being a source of income, it is one of the development sources of a country.
In addition, nowadays, there are lots of countries who lets knowledagble employees from other nationalities to work in their countries. These high skilled workers can be positioned in the places in need. Their ideas can be valued. If a country support them, they can be the new face of the development.
In conclusion, a country always needs development. Development can be achieved through innovation and lots of ideas. I believe that having a mixed population with different nationalites is a one way to do it.",,,,,,7.5,"In recent years, many people have argued that countries with populations made up of various nationalities become more interesting and tend to progress faster. I agree with this view, as diversity brings many advantages to a nation. When people from different backgrounds live together, they share their cultures, languages, and experiences, which makes daily life richer and more exciting. For example, multicultural cities like New York and London are famous for their food, art, and celebrations from all around the world. Moreover, having different nationalities can help a country develop faster because people bring unique skills and ideas. International workers may introduce new technology, solve problems differently, or start businesses that create jobs for everyone. Although some people worry that too much diversity can cause misunderstandings, I believe that as long as there is respect and good communication, the benefits are much greater than the difficulties. All in all, I think that a mix of nationalities makes a country more vibrant and helps it grow in many ways."
1101,2,A country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"There are some beliefs that when there is a mixture of nationalities, a country can improve it's development. In my opinion, I believe these statement can be both true and false at the same time.
Mixture of nationalities may promote country's development as some particular nationalities are more proficient in one particular activity than another nationalities. For example, Jamaican has a superior body in running. They are the whipping out all the gold medals in running. Each nationalities has it's own strongness, so they can help each other to develop the country.
On the other hand, development in the country may not be fast when different nationalities are in one country due to the conflicts between the locals and the foreigners about culture and language differences. Such conflicts may rise and result in slower development as there are going to be communication difficulties between the local citizens and foreigners. In addition, local citizens may be annoyed of foreign people taking away their jobs, creating more anger between each other. To exemplify, USA is one of the country that has multinational population. USA has developed a lot over a past decade and is a leader of technology but at the same time, it contains many social issues such as race hatred. USA is expected to develop less compared to other countries for many reasons, but mainly due to intelligent and competitive foreign experts leaving their country.
In conclusion, I believe different nationalities will play a critical role in the country's development. However, the government should educate their local people to understand and respect other country's cultures in order to maximise the productivity in their country.",,,,,,7.5,"It is often argued that a country with a mix of nationalities becomes more vibrant and progresses at a faster rate. From my perspective, having different nationalities living together can create both advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, the combination of people with various backgrounds provides a wider variety of skills, perspectives, and ideas, which can contribute to innovation and economic growth. For instance, many successful companies in Silicon Valley are owned or led by immigrants, which proves that diversity can lead to outstanding achievements. On the other hand, including many nationalities may also introduce social challenges, such as language barriers and misunderstandings regarding cultural traditions. These differences sometimes cause conflicts within communities or workplaces, making it harder for everyone to work together comfortably. For example, some European countries have experienced tensions as immigrants and locals struggle to adjust to different customs, which occasionally slows down the process of development. Overall, I think that although challenges exist, a country generally benefits from having people of different nationalities, as long as efforts are made to promote mutual respect and understanding among all citizens."
1103,2,"It's generally believed that success in fields such as art and sport can only be achieved if a person has natural talent. However, it's sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or artist.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Most people have oponions that the most essential thing for achieving success in any field such as art and sport is natural talent. Other people disagree with this statement and believe that everybody in their early ages can become a professional sportsmen or artist if they are exellently taught. From my point of view, this is an extrimely controversial topic. I honestly believe that children who are interested in the subject they learn and who have natural abilities for some fields can become more successful than those who just encouraged by adults. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view and then give my review to the issue.
On the one hand, children who have talents from their births can become advanced in the chosen area because they have natural willingness and abilities to succeed in this field. Those youngsters can spend hours without any interraption in the process of making and creating something. By doing this, they improve their abilities and boost their skills, which become more adcanced in each step. Additionally, they are very involve in their studies without stimulation from others that their achievements are inevitable. For example, my son who is three years old enjoy painting and I always notice some improvements in his paintings, that means that he improve his skills in daily basis.
On the other hand, children who do not have talents or nutural abilities for great achievements in any field can be encouraged by adult professionals, who can educate as well as motivate them. For example, when I was a child, I was impressed by music teacher who played the piano in the kindergaten which I visited. After her wonderful performance, I asked my mother to register my for my education in the music school, which was close to our home. So, I was quite motivated to fullfill my dream in getting musical background, that is why I studed hard every day during seven years. I am not only become a musician and got my certificate with exellent marks, but I also won some musical competitions. So, willingness to become successful in chosen field is essential issue.
In conclusion, children who have talents and natural abilities for achievements in any field are easely can become successful because they do not need additional motivation from adults, whereas children who found the sphere which they interested in even without talent can improve their skill by allocating more hours and investing more energy for implementing their dream.",,,,,,7.0,"Many people believe that only children born with exceptional skills can become successful in art or sports, while others argue that anyone can be trained to reach a high level in these areas. Personally, I think that both viewpoints have some truth, but the most successful individuals usually have both some natural ability and a strong work ethic. On the one hand, it is hard to deny that natural talent makes learning easier and progress faster. For example, if a child has a natural sense of rhythm, they might pick up dancing more quickly than others who struggle with timing. This can lead to higher motivation and even better results since they receive praise and rewards for their achievements. On the other hand, dedication and top-level instruction are also essential. Many athletes and artists start without showing much promise but, through hours of practice and guidance from skilled teachers, they gradually become skilled in their fields. As a case in point, my classmate at school joined the volleyball team with little experience, but her determination and regular practice made her one of the best players within two years. In conclusion, while native ability can be a great advantage in art and sports, with enough effort and encouragement, most children can achieve a good level of success in these areas even if they do not start with outstanding natural talent."

-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------
In my opinion, I believe that only a combination of natural talent and sacrifice can lead you to obtain success; for this reason, you can learn and improve several skills, but you will not win against a person with this type of gift, unless this person does not pratice enough.
-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------
To provide an example, if we think about Raffaello, one of the most remarkable painters of all times, and his life we may be disappointed; in fact, thanks to his natural talent he started to paint since he was 8.
However, we have to bear in mind that he constantly made a research in order to discover new techniques and to gain new inspirations.
If he was not so focused on his art's improvement, he would not be able to paint an entire church.
-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------
If we move to another field as sport is always more evident the existence of a pattern. Indeed, it is crystal clear that professional players need to pratice everyday, regardless their talent.
However, Ronaldo this year has winned the nominee for the best football player in the world not only for his innate talent but also for the effort put during training in order to reach always an higher goal.
-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------
In conclusion, through commitment you will obtain good results, but to achieve the highest level you must be gifted with a natural talent.",,,,,,5.5,"It is widely accepted that achieving excellence in artistic or sporting fields is often a result of innate talent, even though others argue that diligent instruction and practice can enable any child to succeed in these areas. On the one hand, there is strong evidence suggesting that natural talent provides a foundation upon which extraordinary abilities can be built; for example, famous basketball players like Michael Jordan or celebrated artists like Leonardo da Vinci demonstrated remarkable abilities from an early age, indicating a kind of inborn advantage. However, it cannot be denied that practical skills and great improvements can come from hard work and persistent effort regardless of one’s natural abilities. Many people who initially show little flair can become proficient artists or sports players if they are encouraged to practice regularly and receive proper guidance. Personally, I believe that while talent can give someone a crucial head start, the highest achievements require a mix of both natural aptitude and relentless hard work; without dedication, even the most talented individuals risk falling behind those who are determined to keep learning. Thus, while talent is significant, the role of consistent effort and learning in reaching success should not be underestimated."

Some people believe that only those who are naturally gifted can perfrom greatly in fields such as art and sport while others do not. This essay will discuss both views and illustrate why anyone through constant practise and hardwork can have a bright future in both of these fields, whether it was sports or art.
Having natural talent in art or sports is surely an advantage that could lead to accomplishments in the future. It puts the person levels above those who are not as fortunate as him or her. For instance, Lionel Messi, arguably the best player to ever kick a ball, is considered by many football fans the most talented play in history. According to Messi's coach, he is not the most dedicated player out of his teammates since he does not put in the same amount of effort as many others, but he certaintly yields the best results. Personally, whenever I see him play, I feel that there is a unvisible force of attraction, similar to a magnet, between his foot and the ball. There are many examples where people invested many hours of their day into learning art, but could not produce something of high quality. My sister, who is 26 years old, is actually one of those examples. She spent 2 hours a day for four years practising art, but she could not draw better than my cousin, who is 12 years and rarely does any drawing.
On the other hand, if someone is willing to put in the work and ready to face whatever it takes to reach the top, he or she will definitely do so, even if no natural is found. After all, certain skills are needed in any field, including sport and art, and by frequent training, those skills could easily be aquirred. One of my close friends was overweight and could not score a single goal in a 90-minute handball match. However, after multiple hours put into improving his technique and abilities, he became the best player in school; he was chosen by the coach as a captain to lead our team in a tournament.
To conclude, although having talent eases the path to success, it is not a requirment for others to do the same thing, if they put in enough effort and have commitment.",,,,,,6.0,"When it comes to excelling in areas like art or sports, opinions are often split between those who think natural talent is necessary and others who believe anyone can achieve greatness through practice and determination. Some people, for example, point to prodigies like Mozart in music or Michael Jordan in basketball, whose extraordinary skills seemed to emerge from an early age. These individuals often stand out in childhood, and their achievements make it seem as though only the gifted can truly succeed. However, there is also strong evidence that effort and repeated practice play a huge part in reaching high levels of skill. My own experience in learning to play the guitar supports this; although I was not naturally talented, by practicing regularly for several years, I am now able to play complicated songs that seemed impossible at the start. Similarly, I once knew a classmate who was not a fast runner but, with months of training, became a key member of our school's track team. In my view, while having natural talent can offer a head start, it is passion, hard work, and consistent training that ultimately determine success in art and sports for most people."

In contrast, I believe, although born without inborn talents, children are well capable of learning art and sport, if they get the correct guidance. Only the self motivation and dedications steer the pathway. For instance, the fastest spinner in Sri lanka was not a runner during his childhood. The sport teacher's entire efforts lift him to the posiition of fastest runner of the country.

A supportive environment, access to good teachers, and a willingness to work hard often make a bigger difference than talent alone.

To conclude, although some top performers in art and sport born with inborn talents to certain extents and gained professionalism with influential surroundings, I trust, most of the achievers in this fields have unprecedented dedications toward learning and practise these skills for their accomplishments, irrespective of the natural talents.",,,,,,6.5,"There are often debates about whether success in areas like art or sport is the result of natural ability or if any child can excel through education and hard work. On the one hand, some people claim that to truly succeed, a person must possess natural talent, as many famous athletes and artists seem to show extraordinary abilities from an early age. For example, Mozart composed music as a child and some athletes break records at a very young age, suggesting something unique in their genes. However, there is also a strong argument that with proper training, support, and persistence, any child can achieve a high level of skill. I have seen friends who were not initially good at painting or football become excellent just by practicing regularly and following good coaches. Research also shows that the brain can develop new skills with repeated effort, meaning that natural talent is not always necessary. In my opinion, while having natural ability may give someone an initial advantage, it is dedication and the right environment that truly shape a person's success in these fields. Therefore, I believe that every child has the potential to become skilled in art or sport if given the proper guidance and motivation."

Now it is posible for scientists and turinsts to go in places remote as the South Pole. This possibility have a double face. Some people believe that it positive to have the opportunity to know and visit places we could just imagined until few years ago. On the other hand, others believe we are the resposible for the distruction of certain natural environment. I believe the disadvantages could exceed the advantages.
Nowadays, thanks to the techonolical development, we have the great possibility to go anywhere and visit extraordinary places like the South Pole. We can see how the animals live, how it is possible to survive under certain climatic conditions. Furthermore, we can develop more accurate analysis and researches. From the scientific point of you the possibility to go in remote places is surely a crucial chance of discover and lerning something about our planet. Certain places in the last years are also becoming open to the turism. This involve that have been organised ways of transortation as well as hotel have been opened. While, one should see these as advantages concerning the economical status of these isolated places, I belive it is the starting point of the destractuction of the natural environment.
Although the workers of turistm sector claim to pay attention in preserving the natural status of places like the South Pole, it is impossibile to believe in them. Indeed, to welcome people and technological instruments is already a way in which a natural enviroment is stressed and ruined. In particular, techonological advices produce radiations, which toghether with chimical and electrical stimuli could afftect the ground of a place like the South Pole. For instance, radiations and electrical stimulations can make the temperature higher and this could be a cause of the environment's ruination. Furthermore, animals who live in the South Pole can be negatively influenced by the turists. Indeed, they are not social animals who have grown up together with human beings. They could get sick because of the noisy sounds produced by humans and by their techonolical advices.

This development presents notable benefits and drawbacks. On the one hand, allowing scientists easier access to these untouched places leads to important discoveries about our planet, such as new animal species, insights into climate change, and the study of unique ecosystems. For instance, researchers at the South Pole can collect ice samples that help to understand changes in the Earth's atmosphere over thousands of years. Tourists, too, have the advantage of experiencing rare and beautiful landscapes, which can encourage a greater appreciation for nature and might even inspire activism for the protection of the environment. However, there are significant disadvantages to consider. The increased human presence, including the infrastructure required for travel and accommodation, can harm fragile ecosystems that evolved in isolation from humans. Pollution, noise, and disturbances from tourist activities can threaten local wildlife and disrupt natural processes that took thousands of years to develop. For example, the introduction of foreign substances or diseases may put native species at risk. In my opinion, while the opportunity to study and witness such places firsthand is invaluable, we must be extremely cautious, as the long-term negative impacts on delicate environments like the South Pole could outweigh the short-term benefits."

Exploring is what scientists and tourists are always like and eager to do because, invariably, unknown keeps an attraction of mystery. However, there are pros and cons in travelling to remote natural environment.
As far as we know, the improvement in science and progress in technology always comes from exploring the unknown destinations. Travelling to a remote natural environment, take the South Pole for example, can conduct many research which cannot be done in common places. These kinds of research is helpful in Biology and in finding the origin of human being. The second biggest advantage is that it can improve the tourism in its local area, and tourism means a better condition for local people. In the past, in some remote places of China without torism, the native people there had a poor sanitory condition and after the arrivals of travellers, people there can earn a living and improve their living conditions.
However, everything in the world has its donwside. The activities in scientific research and commerce will cause contalmination to the environment in remote places. For instance, the constructions of the scientific stations have occupied the places where many wild animals there used to call home. There is no doubt that such activities will lead to a decrease in the number of these animals which will also influent the local ecosystem.

These discoveries may provide valuable insights into topics such as global warming and the Earth's history. Moreover, tourism in remote regions often creates economic opportunities for nearby communities, thereby improving living standards and infrastructure, much like the effect tourism has had in Himalayan villages. On the other hand, increased human activity in these fragile environments poses significant risks to their ecosystems. The construction of research bases or tourist facilities may disturb wildlife habitats, pollute pristine areas, and even introduce invasive species that threaten native life forms. For example, waste left by visitors can have a long-lasting negative impact on the environment, which takes decades to recover. In conclusion, while making remote areas accessible has clear advantages for science and the economy, it is equally important to recognize and manage the environmental harm that may result from such activities."

South Pole is a place which has ever seen human activities before, and it seems to have numerous discoveries to make. Indeed, scientists which fauna and flora are the current studies, could find new mode of the marine life and discover new species. Moreover, people who are interested in travelling to South Pole might now do it, children who dreamed about polar animals could see them. Thus, the tourism should create new jobs and develop economic growth.
Nevertheless, as each breakthrough that the society does, there are repercussions. In this case, the harmful effect of this discovery is global warming because when humans go somewhere, they let a carbon footprint which directly changes the environment. For instance, if individuals had to travel to South Pole, they would only use air or marine transport such as cruise ship which pollute the area with greenhouse gases. As a result, those greenhouse gases can warm nature which, unfortunately, would melt the ice and have a detrimental impact on the landscapes. As a consequence, in the forthcoming decades, this panorama may disappear. Thereby, if scientists want to study this natural area, they could not or in a limited way.

It' is often argued that there are some benefits and drawbacks of this type of journey. I believe there are some drawbacks of this pursuit, but I see more benefits as it might allow researchers and especially travellers to explore natural ecosystem safely without destroying it.
First of all remote travelling will give broad opportunities scientists to research more untouchable natural ecosystems. Those researches' results might play a crucial role to understand our nature well and therefore to take firm steps to protect it. For example, the growing researches showed, that after thourough exploration of the North and South Capes, scientists could finally understand the devastating effect of the Global warming, as researches revealed dramatically melting process of the glaciers. Though remote research might be base for some scientific breakthrough, however in some cases, it's important to be in a place personally to measure changes not only visually but also to take some lab examples.

This phenomenon spurs the discussion about the underlying reasons, such as the detrimental influence of parents and other people acting improperly. This essay will explore the causes and impacts of extensive drug use among young people, and introduce plausible suggestions to address this issue.
The dominant cause of this problem is the publicity of pharmaceutical companies that exaggerating the efficacy of their products while playing down or concealing the side effects of such drugs, notably, the drugs that can alleviate the tiredness and improve the mood while risking addiction or even the loss of rationality. These drugs help teenagers a lot in terms of avoiding the sleepiness, especially in classes and lectures where they have to focus on the knowledge points expressed by teachers and lecturers. However, given the lack of information about the adverse effects involved, teenagers may gradually get addicted to such drugs. The other contributing factor is the absence of attention paid by parents who more often than not, have to deal with the tremendous workload so that they have little time spent with their children. The improper drug use exerts far-reaching impacts on teenagers and adolescents. The most notable effect in this regard is the deterioration of health conditions, both physically and mentally, as exemplified by the higher frequency of asthma and the worsening ability of socialising.
To tackle this problem, it is necessary for pharmacential corporations to clarify the pros and cons of their products, and for parents to spend more time with their children to identify potential hazards.

One contributing cause is the widespread exposure young people have to substance use through media and, too often, in their own homes where adults may openly misuse prescription or recreational drugs. This normalizes drug consumption and makes it appear as an acceptable coping mechanism for stress or social pressures. Additionally, the competitive nature of education and societal expectations can lead teenagers to experiment with stimulants or relaxants in order to improve performance or escape anxiety. The effects of early drug use are far-reaching, ranging from immediate health risks like impaired judgment and addiction, to long-term consequences such as poor academic outcomes and difficulties in forming stable relationships. To counteract these dangers, it is crucial that parents and community leaders model responsible behavior and communicate clearly about the risks of drug abuse.

In this essay, i am going to discuss the causes and some consequences of the widespread abuse of drugs by young adults, and give some recommendations that will help combat this trend.
To begin, it is a well known fact that the abuse of drugs can cause some devastating effects to the consumer. A lot of youths today, learnt this lifestyle from their parents, or thier immediate environment. For example, a teenager whose parents take cocaine, will inevitably take after the parents, afterall, an apple does not fall far away from its tree.
Also, a teenager that smokes illegal drugs like marijuana, might not even live to tell the rest of the stories. The chemical components of this drug are incredibly strong, that when abused, can lead to psychological symptoms, like, hallucinations, delusions, and even in worst cases death. A recent study, showed that 75% of young adults, who suffer from hallucinations and delusions, are as a result of intake of hard drugs.
In terms of recommendations, the governments should set up addiction clinic to help combat the ubiquitous trend among youths. This will go a long way in alleviating the addiction towards drugs. There should also be an awareness created to help instill fear into obstinate teenagers. Psychotherapy should also be recommended.

Several factors contribute to this troubling trend, but one major cause is the negative influence set by adults in their lives, such as parents or celebrities who glamorize drug use. For instance, if a child grows up in a household where family members regularly smoke or drink excessively, they are likely to replicate the behavior, believing it to be normal. Social pressure is also a significant factor; young people often feel compelled to fit in with friends who use drugs, or may seek to escape stress and anxiety through substance use. The effects of drug abuse among youth are devastating, leading not only to health issues like addiction and mental illness, but also to poor academic performance and crime. To curb this dangerous pattern, governments should invest in robust public education campaigns about the risks of drug use and provide support for parents to model healthy behavior. Moreover, schools should offer counselling and extracurricular activities to keep young people engaged in positive environments.

This has drawn the attention of the youth either by a drug addict parent or a friend. Moreover, the number of youngsters taking drugs has increased dramatically throughout the years as there are people who provide these drugs in the black market. This critical issue has caused serious issues both socially and mentally.
The social and mental impact of using drugs by the youngsters have damaged the educational progress, the social participation such as family and friends gatherings. Additionally, lack of stamina, weight loss, and loss of appetite are key factors of excessive use of drugs.
There is a number of contributing elements to the phenomena. One of these elements is the sense of belonging to a group. Since humans are social animals, young people want to have the feeling of being accepted and loved, and this can be sensible when it comes to a group of friends.

Some people think that the closure of local business will bring about the death of local communities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In recent years, improvement and immense expansion of supermarkets, including convenience stores often takes place of the local business. Some people are concerned that their own local businesses will be taken by large companies. Although it is understandable to feel scared, and anxious, I disagree with this idea. People always need to adjust the issue flexibly. I would like to share examples and ideas in Japanese society.
To begin with, the majority of society is based on capitalist society. This means that people who run their own businesses are always competitive with competitors. This means that large companies are more beneficial to provide more convenient and high-quality services with affordable finance and ideas. For example, Japanese convenience stores are monopolized by three companies. These companies' stores are ubiquitous around Japan and they provide literary convenient services. Customers can buy magazines, underwear, and some special products, such as instant noodles which are featured by famous noodle restaurants. Customers can always buy the same products around Japan. Therefore, it must be difficult for local convenience stores to fight against large companies.
Secondly, this phenomenon is not necessarily cause a negative effect on local businesses and communities. As I mentioned above, it will cause more convenient to local people. Furthermore, the people who used to run the local convenience store will be able to run the large companies' convenience stores as franchised stores by taking advantage of their own experience. Furthermore, running some stores and companies, instead of running only one company is getting standard for entrepreneurs because they can prepare for the fast-paced society. The more they can constantly increase their profit , the more options have on whether they should compensate for a deficit sales figure in a store or company. Furthermore, they can just terminate the company and focus on the profitable company. By doing this process, they can survive in the competitive society.
In conclusion, it is unpredictable which industries and services suddenly emerge and take place of their own business. Therefore, people always need to keep up with this fast-paced society.",,,,,,6.0,"The rapid expansion of supermarkets has undoubtedly changed the business landscape in many countries, leading to the decline of small, local shops. While some argue this shift destroys the fabric of local communities, I partially agree, but believe the effects are more nuanced. On one hand, local businesses often serve as important meeting spaces and foster strong relationships among neighbors, so their disappearance can weaken social ties. For instance, in my hometown, the closure of a popular family-owned bakery meant not just the loss of unique bread, but also the end of morning conversations and local traditions. On the other hand, supermarkets provide a greater variety of goods at lower prices, which benefits families on tight budgets and saves time. Moreover, some local businesses adapt by specializing in niche products or partnering with larger chains, finding ways to survive and even thrive. In conclusion, while the loss of small businesses can impact the sense of community, I believe that adaptation and innovation can help both communities and businesses evolve alongside supermarket growth."

This phaenomenon have caused the development and expansion of supermaket but also the closure of local businesses. I agree with the part of people who think that local business play a vital role in the life of local commuities that will be almost death in the next few years.
In Italy 50 years ago to buy food people had to go to street market. They used to buy km 0 products respecting the season of production of fruit of vegetables. People have to talk to each other, people have to go shopping respecting the workhours of people who had to produce the products and then sold them. In the last year, supermaket have caught on. Their goal is to offer how many products possible, without taking care of the season in which a certain product should be found in the market. For instace, if you want to buy cherries in winter now you can to to the nearest supermarket and find them, even if is November. By contrast, before supermarket's developement people had to wait the productive season of cherries and waint until summer to eat them. This phaenomenon had take people to prefer supermarket because they can find more products. However the consequences of this choice are in my opinion dramatic.
First of all, the clousure of local business is causing a breakdown on the economical status of different countries. For instance, in Sicily there are still different people who work the ground and survive because they produce and sell their own products. It used to be their job. However, because of the supermakert their job is not apprecciated and they are losing money and the possibility to continue their job. This dramatic phaenomenon is surely causing the death of local communities because a vital part of the community itself is losing job. Another example coming from my personal experience might be the following. Nowadays you can buy a product to clean and polish your shoes in a supermaket. 50 years ago my grandfather used to go to the city center where a man used to clean and polish the shoes for him. It was his job. I had the extraordinary opportunity to meet this old man who clean and polish my shoes for little money. He was happy because, even if he is conscious that is almost impossibile, he hope to have the opportunity to do this job as long as possible. He told me that to clean shoes on the street for fifty years have given him the opportunity to meet people and to talk with them. After I have known him, I thought that because of globalisation we are losing our roots as well as the possibility of knowing our own place and people.
In conclusion, I believe that the phaenomenon of supermarket's expansion is causing the death of local communities. I also think that, although time changes and new habits are followed, we have at least to be conscious and recognise what we are losing.",,,,,,6.0,"The rapid growth of supermarkets in various countries has led to the decline of local businesses, and I strongly agree that this trend threatens the life of local communities. Small, local businesses are more than just places to buy goods; they build relationships and support the local economy in ways large supermarkets often do not. For example, in my town, there used to be a family-run bakery where everyone not only bought bread but also caught up with neighbors and shared news. Since a big supermarket chain opened nearby, the bakery closed, and now it feels like people do not connect as much as they used to. Additionally, local businesses typically buy products from nearby farmers and artisans, keeping money within the community, while supermarkets usually import goods from other regions or countries for lower prices. As a result, many people lose their jobs, and traditional skills start to disappear. From my own experience, I remember visiting small vegetable shops where the owners would even tell customers how to cook certain products, creating a friendly atmosphere. But now, most of these small shops are gone, replaced by impersonal aisles full of products where nobody knows your name. Overall, I believe that although supermarkets offer convenience and variety, their rise comes at the cost of local culture, jobs, and social interactions, leading to the slow ""death"" of local communities."

Many individuals believe that the shut down of local business could end the local communities. I fully consider that the generalisation of commercial market could destroy the spirit of localities because if owners closed their business, it would disappear local and familiar places for inhabitants and create a negative mental health.
Before having this modern invention, namely supermakets, local shops such as bakery or butcher have been there and where a place of regroupment and conviviality. However, due to the competitiveness of supemarket and the globalization of items, individuals may prefer to purchase in it rather than to go to each local business. This phenomenon decrease the visits of customers in small shops and would not help to boost their incomes. As a consequence, if local shops, which should be most of them in the city center due to old architecture such as in Europe, shut down, there will be no longer activities or inhabitants, and in the forthcoming decades, the city could be desertic.
Moreover, small businesses created employment, if they closed, people would make redundants. Indeed, in many research when people lose their jobs, it may create a negative mood and at worst sometimes a depression. This is to say that if everyone were discharged due to all those shut down, effects could be detrimental on local communities. For instance, in small cities, many events are organized such as parties or barbecues. However, if the population had a negative mood, anyone would join these activities which, normally, increase the dynamism of a city.
To conclude, I fully think that supermaket is a harmful places for the well-being of localities because it could stop or curb cities' actions.",,,,,,6.0,"In recent years, the rapid growth of supermarkets has threatened the survival of many small, local businesses, and although some argue that this could lead to the decline of local communities, I strongly agree with this perspective. Local shops are often at the heart of community life, offering not only personalized service but also a space for residents to interact and form social bonds. For example, when small bakeries or convenience stores close down, people lose daily face-to-face interactions that help strengthen neighborhood ties. Additionally, local businesses frequently support other regional producers, which keeps more money circulating within the community. If these businesses disappear, both economic opportunities and the unique character of the town are likely to fade, making the area less vibrant and appealing. Furthermore, the closure of local enterprises results in fewer jobs for residents, which can increase unemployment and social isolation. In my town, for instance, the arrival of a large supermarket led to the collapse of multiple independent shops, and within a few years, the local market square, once full of life, became quiet and empty. Therefore, I believe the dominance of supermarkets can seriously harm the fabric of local communities by eroding social connections and undermining local economies."

personally i agree with limited extent to this idea , however i still believe there is a room for small business in some areas around the world .In the following essay i will enlighten some outlines and explain the reasons behind my opinion.
Some people think that availability of big supermarkets in USA and Canada for example , with all varieties they have in different sectors will attract costumers from all ages to satsisfy their needs , and that idea is correct if we consider the time we spend in one small shop to buy few items then we have to drive for further location to buy another purchase we need which wasnt available in first shop .
Nevertheless , small cities and some countries with less development still have less from these enormous supermarkets people in these areas still depend in other way to buy their needs from small local shops .For instance in middle east countries with big population like jordan or iraq , there's million of people who suffer from long distance tranport to find big shops to fillful all their needs . Whilst
they can figure out few small shops around them to find what they want .

Supermarkets obviously offer convenience and lower prices, making shopping easier for many people, especially in big cities where life is busy and choices are valued. However, local businesses often provide personalized service and unique products that supermarkets cannot offer, and in smaller towns or rural areas, these shops still play a vital role in daily life. For example, in my own town, although we have two big supermarkets, many residents continue to buy bread from the family bakery and vegetables from the local market, because they trust the quality and know the owners personally. In addition, small shops often support community events or local charities in ways that large corporations do not.

My cusion told me once the big supermarkert open in this neighborhood, grasp many couples or familly to live here. Eventually, that rural place's population is surged.
Someone thought giant grocery's product cheap price can not compete with local product, that make local place to close. I considered it is anachromism idea. Now the customer's purchasing value is totally diffrent with previous eras. Buyer start choose organic product and eco-friendlly or morality brand. If local stores have their own unique products, which are not replace with other, such as handmade cheese and unique taste of bread, local bussiness can compete with global chain markets.

Furthermore, while it is true that supermarkets offer convenience and often lower prices, many community members still value the unique products and personalized service that local shops provide, such as hand-crafted foods or locally sourced goods. Instead of disappearing, some local businesses adapt by focusing on specialty items or collaborating through markets and festivals, which helps maintain the community’s character and social bonds.

1149,2,Write about the following topic.Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.Discuss both views and give your opinionGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The education of children is surely one of the hottest topic debated. What are the subjects and the skills that children have to learn and what help them to grow up better? According to one view, art is vital for the growht of children and therefore it has to be a school subject. On the other hand, there are people who think that to do art at school is a waste of time. I believe that to study art is fundamental for at least two different factors and then it should be teached in the schools. Surely, more dignity should be deserved to it.
To study art at the different level of education is essential for the development of certain skills. First of all, those children who play with art develop the ability to measure, to structure a picture as well as delineate the border of a page earlier than those children who are not educated in drawing. They start recognising pictures and to distinguish between the colors and their possible mixtures. The second reason, by contrast, is linked with some psychological implications that to do art involves. To do art does not mean just to draw. Art can help adults to understand children and their needs. Children, thanks to the drawing activity, can start expressing their emotions and desire using pictures and colors. They can start working with their imagination before they learn the acquire the writing and reading skills. These two reasons lead some people to believe that is fundamental for children to do art. Then, art has to be a subject and considered as useful as Mathematics and English. The development of creativity and critical thinking that art implies is extraordinary useful. Indeed, children are led to understand practically what they have to do if they commit an error when they are drawing. They start to think about the errors they can made as possibility to do something new and original.
By contrast, there are people who dislike the idea that art can be compared to other subjects like Math and Science. They believe that art is more an hobby than something useful. Since there are no notions that a child can memorise and there are not test a teacher can prepare to understand the level of the children, art cannot be considered a subject. Therefore, there are no reasons to teach it in schools. However, the reasons presented by those who do not want to add art in the list of school subjects are misguided. They start from the idea that to learn means to stay hours in front of a book. This is obsiusly true but it is not enough. There is a fundamental part of learning that is advantaged by practical activities like art.
In conclusion, I believe that art is a subject and should be considered as such. The notions learnt by drawing are as essential as the first basis of grammar, keeping the necessary differences. Since children have to develop different skills, art as a school subject should be supported because it help children to develop at least creativity and critical reasoning as well as to express their emotions.",,,,,,6.0,"There is still much debate about whether art should be part of the standard curriculum for children in schools. Some people believe that art is crucial because it encourages young students to think creatively and to develop skills that are otherwise difficult to measure through traditional subjects. For example, working with paint or clay can help children learn how to express themselves and discover new ways of solving problems, which is just as important as memorizing facts in science or math. Art can also serve as a way for students to relax and find joy in school, making the educational environment more enjoyable. On the other hand, some argue that art does not offer clear, practical benefits and takes time away from subjects that are seen as more important for future job opportunities, like math or language. Because art often lacks strict tests or obvious measurable progress, it can be seen as less valuable. However, I think this view misses the real importance of a balanced education. Giving children the chance to learn art not only helps some of them discover hidden talents, but also gives everyone the experience to think differently. In my opinion, schools should definitely include art as a subject, because it supports emotional development and encourages innovation, both of which are essential for a child’s growth."

For example, a shy student could use painting to communicate what they are experiencing inside. On the other hand, some people think that since time at school is limited, it is better spent learning academic subjects that will directly help with future jobs, such as science and technology. In my opinion, I think art is valuable and should be part of the school program because it gives children a chance to discover talents they might not know they have and can also make learning at school more enjoyable. Even though strong knowledge in math or science is important, not every child will be successful using only those skills, so I believe art provides an important balance in education."

In my opinion, since only art permits the develop of children's creativity, it has to be considered as important as the other school subjects such as science or history.
In 2018, it was conducted a research among 100 children in which only half of them were following art classes. The resulting outcome was mind-blowing: in fact, those which had the opportunity to learn more about art had develop their creative skills, while the others, athough some of them had a natural talent, had not made any improvement. Hence, the result has underlined the importance of this subject.
On the other hand, some people think that children use the hours of art in school only to have fun and play with colours. I believe that this is partly true; however, since children have the right to express theirselves, this time in which art is taught plays an important role in their education. For instance, many studies have underlined that children suffering from ADHD (a psychological issue that causes hyperactivity), since they are using their energies painting and creating sculptures, can be calmer thanks to art.
In conclusion, I believe that art has to be taken into consideration with the same importance given to the other subjects because it leads to several benefits for children and, for this reason, teachers have the duty to teach them art properly, thus permitting children to become artists one day.",,,,,,6.5,"There are differing opinions about whether art should be a core subject in schools, with some people claiming it is crucial for children's development, while others view it as unnecessary. Supporters of art education argue that it allows students to think creatively and see the world from different perspectives, which is important not only for artistic careers but also for problem-solving in any field. For example, studies in several countries, including Finland and Japan, have shown that students who regularly participate in arts classes tend to perform better in subjects like math and science, perhaps because art helps them develop concentration and innovative thinking. Nevertheless, critics state that art takes up time that could be better used for academic subjects that are more directly linked to future success, such as mathematics, technology, or languages. They feel that arts activities can be reserved for after-school clubs rather than school hours. However, in my view, including art as an essential subject is important since schools should educate children in a balanced way, nurturing not only their logical thinking but also their emotional intelligence and imagination. It is through drawing, painting, or music that many children discover their passions and future talents, so making art part of the curriculum helps them become well-rounded individuals."

Whether someone sees its value or not, art will one way or another find its way in our children's lives and have an influence. I strongly believe that art is crucial for our children to have as a subject at school and in this article I will try to explain why I believe so and give examples.
One of the major reasons why art is so essential is the diversity of the genres of art. Art could be in the form of playing music instruments, drawing, acting or even doing martial arts.
This diversity gives children the ability to choose what suits them best and focus on getting better at them. Not only that,but this also forms a big part of their personality. It is scientifically proven that this increases the average IQ of a child and it protects from depression later in the children's lives.
On the other hand, some parents have a different point of view, they see art as a distraction, believing that only merely scientific subjects are the real deal. However, their view may seem to look logical, as their wish is that their children would grow up to be doctors, scientists or something similar. I believe this is a noble goal but why not a doctor who can play a guitar? Or a scientist who is also a good actor ? Would not that be a great hobby to have in their free time?
An example that I encountered was when I started to learn martial arts and played the guitar and how this greatly helped me overcome a really tough time in my life and fight off depression.
In conclusion, I believe art is a subject that every student needs and to choose which suit them best later helps their lives drastically.",,,,,,7.5,"There has always been a debate about the importance of art in the school curriculum, with some arguing that it is a vital subject, while others claim it is not necessary and can be a waste of precious study time. Supporters of art education believe that artistic activities, such as painting, music, or drama, encourage children to use their imagination and develop creativity, which are essential skills for future problem-solving and innovation. Art also allows students to express their emotions, build confidence, and sometimes even find relaxation from the pressures of academic life. Conversely, those who oppose art classes in schools often say that time would be better spent on subjects like mathematics, science, or languages, which are seen as more practical for future job prospects. They worry that focusing on art may distract students from these core subjects and reduce their chances of academic success. Personally, I believe that art holds a unique value and should not be left out of children's education. In my own experience, taking art classes made me more attentive to detail and improved my ability to think creatively in all areas of study, which not only helped in school projects but also in everyday problem-solving. Therefore, while it is important to ensure a strong foundation in traditional subjects, I think art plays an equally critical role in a well-rounded education and the healthy development of children."

In this, I will discuss both the arguments and give my better opinion.
To begin with, That art subject is important for children's growth. Research shows that art is a creative way or language to depict the feelings of children while it also indicates that they are a better solution to release the stress by drawing. Some studies also suggested that they are a remedy to those who are suffering from anxiety or depression as it helps to release the oxytocin in the body to feel good. Furthermore, it helps to improve the mental growth of children.
Meanwhile, other people think that it is just a waste of time for their children as it does not provide any beneficial things in contrast to the mathematical subjects and it is expensive for their pocket.

On one hand, art encourages creativity and provides students a way to express their emotions, which is essential for their overall development. For instance, drawing and painting can help children who may struggle with expressing themselves through words, and many experts believe that engaging in artistic activities can increase problem-solving abilities. On the other hand, there are those who consider art to be less important than subjects like mathematics or science and feel that it does not directly contribute to a child’s future career success. They also point out that art supplies and classes can be costly, which might not be practical for every school or family. Despite these concerns, I believe that learning art should be an essential part of the school curriculum, as it provides a healthy balance to academic life and allows students to discover their unique talents. Including art alongside traditional subjects can help nurture confident, well-rounded individuals who are prepared for various challenges in life."

In this, I will discuss both the arguments and give my better opinion.
To begin with, That art subject is important for children's growth. Research shows that art is a creative way or language to depict the feelings of children while it also indicates that they are a better solution to release the stress by drawing. Some studies also suggested that they are a remedy to those who are suffering from anxiety or depression as it helps to release the oxytocin in the body to feel good. Furthermore, it helps to improve the mental growth of children.
Meanwhile, other people think that it is just a waste of time for their children as it does not provide any beneficial things in contrast to the mathematical subjects and it is expensive for their pocket. People also think that it is not going to provide real value in the life of their children and some parents object that school should remove this subject from their curriculum while some children's are also not interested in this type of subjects.
In conclusion, both arguments hold valid reasons as some people think is detrimental for their children whereas others think it is not an essential thing for their children. In my opinion, the parents and school should have consent their children or students that if they want to study this subject or not.",,,,,,5.5,"There are differing opinions on whether art should be considered a vital subject for children in schools. On one hand, supporters argue that studying art helps children develop their imagination, improves their ability to express thoughts and emotions, and can even boost self-confidence. For example, students who struggle in more traditional classes sometimes find success and motivation through participating in art-related activities. Additionally, learning art can teach valuable skills such as patience and attention to detail. On the other hand, some people believe that art classes do not prepare children for the practical demands of life, and that time could be better spent learning core subjects like science or mathematics. They often point out that resources spent on art supplies could be used for other academic needs, and that not every child is interested in art. In my opinion, although it is important for schools to focus on essential academic subjects, art should still be offered, as it provides a unique way for children to grow and discover new talents, even if not every student chooses to pursue it deeply."

In the last years people used to relying on the private car to move around. . Although the possible reasons that persuaded people to use private cars, the problems that rise from their excessive use, such us traffic and pollution, are harsh consequences to be accepted. I think that an improvement of public trasportation and to incentive the use of ecological means of trasport like bicycle should be possible solution to those issues.
Cars are considered the most confortable mean of trasport. In particular, if you have to move in a big cities like Milan. Indeed, means of trasports sometimes are late or full and also more unsafe. If you are a woman, for example, the use of public trasportation in some part of Italy is not safe mostly during the night hours. Another problem is that of comfort. If people use their car they can go whethever they want, when they want. If they have to spend more time in a place, they have not to be worried about the last bus they had to take to come back home.
However, over-reliance of cars cause at least two big problmes: traffic and pollution. On the one hand, the problem of traffic will produce other issues such as anxiety and irritation. Indeed, if you have to go work in the morning and you live in a city like Rome you have to consider at least one hour spent in the traffic. Pollution is surely the most severe issue. Indeed, if all the people used to take a private car, then it is easely imaginable how much cars and fuel can be consumed daily. The two problems are linked, I want to underline, indeed, the noise pollution that derives from an intense traffic. It should be considered dangerous both for persons and animals.
Two possible solutions to the problem of the over-reliance on cars are the following. Firstly, public trasportation should be improved. Indeed, if bus and tram were more safe and more confortable, then people would be more tent by their use. At least, they will solve the problem of traffic. On the other hand, I see the echologycal means of transport like bycicle as the new border to pass in order to save the world from pollution. One possible suggestion would be that of make cheaper the bycicle and also to give an economic subsidy to those people who decide to help the planet using them.
In conclusion, I believe that the the use of private cars, because of the problems that it causes, should be discouraged. Two possible solutions rely on the improvement of public trasportation and on the incentive can be given to those using non-polluting means of trasport",,,,,,5.5,"Cars have become a vital part of modern life, and in recent years, more and more individuals depend on their private vehicles above all else. This increasing dependence on cars leads to many difficulties, such as heavy traffic congestion on the roads and alarming levels of air pollution. In many cities where everyone drives their own car, it is common to see long delays during rush hours, which causes people to lose time and experience stress. Additionally, the emission of harmful gases from car engines greatly contributes to global warming and makes the air harder to breathe, especially for people with asthma or allergies. One effective way to address these issues is to invest in reliable and affordable public transportation. For example, when the metro system in my city was improved and more buses were added, many commuters switched to public transport, and traffic jams became less frequent. If governments encourage citizens to take buses or trains by making public transportation faster, cheaper, and safer, and also create better cycling paths, then the negative effects of car overuse could be significantly reduced. Ultimately, while private cars are convenient, encouraging people to use alternative options is necessary to make our cities healthier and more enjoyable places to live."

The following essay will illuminate the problems of people relying on private cars and possible solutios to deal with that .
Nowadays , people have to drive hours to arrive their works , schools and shops they determined . However , in order to arrive quickly and comfortably ,people tend to drive their own cars ,even though if they have to drive long distances . As a result of that , many issues are considered like, traffic congestion and pollution of environment. Furhtermore, buying cars are expensive and cost alot of saving money ,which can add more financial burden over mid class families. Moreover , having more cars on the road ,increase the risk for accidents which could be fatal in many conditions.
However , having such problems had pushed governments to put plans to resolve them .For instance ,in some countires in Europe ,alot of money spent by governments to improve public tranport , also these countries encourage their people to use public transport by having low price tickets .In fact , today many people in France and Spain have decided to use subways , trains and buses as ulternative way to tranport . Likewise , in Canada , USA and Australia , as a result of having big lands ,big hospitals have offered to transfer some patients with critical medical conditions by heliocopters .
In summary . Although , disadvantages of driving long distances beside economic aspect of buying expensive cars , some people would rather to drive their personal cars in pursue their destinations.

One significant problem is the rise of traffic congestion, particularly during rush hour when thousands of individuals choose to drive rather than use public transit. This congestion not only wastes time but also contributes to air pollution, as cars produce emissions that harm the environment and pose health risks. Another concern is the financial burden that comes from owning and maintaining a private vehicle, which includes costs for fuel, repairs, insurance, and parking. Additionally, heavy reliance on cars can lead to a decrease in physical activity, as people might be less likely to walk or cycle to their destinations, affecting overall public health. A practical solution to these challenges is investing in and promoting efficient public transportation systems. For example, cities that have improved their bus and train networks, such as Tokyo and Berlin, have seen lower levels of congestion and pollution because more residents choose these alternatives. Governments can also encourage public transport use by making it more affordable and convenient, such as offering discounted fares or expanding service routes. By taking these steps, communities can reduce their dependence on private cars, lessening environmental impact and improving the quality of urban life."

The use of the car as the main means of travel leads, first of all, to an increase in the number of cars and thus to traffic disruption. This disruption exacerbates drivers stress and increases the number of accidents.
The other disadvantage of permanent car use is pollution. More cars means more gases escaping and therefore a danger for our planet in a short time.
Many solutions exist to deal with this situation. First of all, I think of free public transport. As gasoline becomes more and more expensive, people might consider using public transportation more often. Since a bus can carry so many people, this solution will reduce the number of cars on the streets and solve the problems on the previous paragraph.
Another solution might be to create public transport that is totally green, in other words without greenhouse gas emissions. Sometimes people think that large-scale transport causes a lot of pollution. Solving this problem could change their minds and, of course, help our planet.
In conclusion, people think that using only private cars is easier and more appropriate, but they do not realize that this behavior leads to environmental and health problems. To help them change their behavior, free environmentally friendly public transport can be the solution.",,,,,,6.5,"In recent years, an increasing number of individuals have turned to the private car as their primary mode of transportation, which has contributed to various issues in society. One significant problem that comes from car over-reliance is the congestion on city roads, particularly during rush hours, making commutes slow and stressful for everyone. Additionally, many vehicles on the streets release harmful exhaust fumes, which degrade air quality and contribute to global climate change. Another downside is that an overuse of cars often discourages physical activity such as walking or biking, which can have a negative effect on people’s health. To alleviate these problems, one effective solution is for governments to invest in efficient and affordable public transport systems. For example, if reliable trains or buses are available at regular intervals and at a low cost, people may be more willing to leave their car at home. It is also helpful to improve infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians, making these alternatives safer and more attractive. In summary, while cars provide convenience, over-dependence on them causes traffic, pollution, and health issues, and encouraging public transit along with active transport options is a good way to address these problems."

But, overusage of car from people can lead to air pollution and destruction to the environment as greenhouse gases are produced, which are harmful to our body. To solve this problem, many countries are encouraging people to use electronic car or campaigning to use bus or train when they commute.
2 weeks ago, I saw an environmental documentary from the television and I heard the cause of air pollution. There were many factors that could effect the air pollution, but one of the factors was the usage of the car. When we ride a car, the car produces harmful chemical gases such as carbon dioxide that lead to foggy weather. If we inhale this gases often, our lungs will become unhealthy and in worst case, lead to death. Therefore, over-reliance on cars will increase the number of people with lung disease as they produce bad chemicals.
To prevent production of harmful chemicals from the car, many people have to use bus or train for transportation rather than their private car, so government have to do campaign to use them and make festival to persuade people to use public transport. This will help the environment to reduce greenhouse gases and people to inhale more fresh air than before.

This in turn has entailed various repercussions on people's lives. In this essay I will be trying to address a few pitfalls that might be resulted from the rising dependence on cars, and then I will try to consolidate some available solutions.
With the recent development in the car industry, private cars have been quite affordable products for a large portion of the society. Therefore, most of the people have started to travel by their own cars toward their destinations. This increase in vehicles traveling in the streets has alarmingly caused many traffic jams, and these in turn have costed the national economics enormous lost work hours. Moreover, the extent of the air pollution has been widened as a result of the increasing toxic materials emitted into the air. In addition, number of traffic accidents apparently has seen an expected surge, since it has a proportional relation to cars quantities travelling within the cities.
In order to minimize the problems mentioned above, a few solutions can be offered. First, governments should pour more money into developing the public transportation infrastructures, which might encourage employees to forgo their private cars and alternatively take the bus or train. Other notion which merits consideration, employers should intervene and organize group transits for transferring workers from and to their homes. In tourism circles, if there had been more focus on group packages, many tourists would have preferred to leave their cars at home.

1171,2,Write about the following topic.Rich countries should allow jobs for skilled and knowledgeable employees who are from poor countries. Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"As we all know, recruitment is a continuous process that has been evolving over the past years. Nowadays, selection of qualified applicants is a tedious job which involves a considerable amount of time and effort. It has been stated that wealthy countries must allow experienced and intelligent employees from impoverished countries to secure a job in an affluent nation. I completely agree with this statement. In this essay, reasons and examples will be discussed further.
Recruitment mainly involves identification of potential applicants, screening, interviewing and hiring candidates for a particular organization. It may seem a daunting task for those working in human resources. With the advent of technology, the process is simplified, faster and more convenient. Mostly, email is used for applying and sending the credentials abroad, chances of getting hired is often possible. For instance, many immigrants from Asia, which belongs to developing countries are able to successfully obtain an employment in North America with the help of social media platforms. Also, with their valuable experience and rewarding career in the past, they were able to practice their profession in newly industralized countries.
It is beneficial for them to accept skilled workers from economically poor countries to fill in the vacancies in labor market. For instance, a highly respected nurse who earned her bachelor's degree back home decided to work overseas as a healthcare aide eventhough she's overqualified for the position while waiting for her credential evaluation and license. This scenario depicts that rich countries benefit and utilize this person's ability to contribute significantly in the economy.
In addition, job recruitment is advantageous for the country since talents and skills of the people from developing countries has been internationally recognized, thereby giving a sense of pride and honor. Moreover, hiring of people overseas should be a fair procedure that takes into consideration the most indispensable requirement which is skills and knowledge, not merely based on the worker's country of origin. However, there are also drawbacks associated from recruitment of foreign workers which include increasing costs, loss of cultural ties and conflict of interest.
From my perspective, I am in favor of hiring people from third world countries since majority of these people has the expertise, achievements and excellent communication skills which are desirable attributes of an employee. With enough manpower, it will address the staffing crisis and labor shortage in rich countries.",,,,,,7.5,"In the current era of globalization, there is considerable debate regarding the employment of skilled and knowledgeable individuals from less wealthy countries by richer nations. I am of the strong opinion that affluent countries should indeed open their job markets to such talent from poorer regions. First and foremost, this approach helps fill critical gaps in the workforce that local populations may not be able to meet, especially in fields like healthcare, technology, and engineering, where labor shortages are often prevalent. For example, many hospitals in Europe and North America rely on doctors and nurses trained in countries like India and the Philippines, whose expertise is highly valued. Furthermore, allowing skilled workers from developing countries not only benefits the receiving country’s economy but also offers opportunities for individuals to improve their standard of living and, through remittances, support their families back home. Additionally, when rich countries embrace talent from abroad, it fosters cultural exchange and innovation, as diverse perspectives often lead to creative solutions in the workplace. Of course, measures should be in place to ensure fair recruitment and proper integration, but the advantages far outweigh any potential drawbacks. In conclusion, employing skilled workers from poorer countries is mutually advantageous for both individuals and nations, and I strongly support policies that encourage such movement."

Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In development countries they must allow works for people who have skills and experience employees from poor countries. I agree with this point of view because everyone they should have a chance. There were a opportunities and benefits.
The first point, I would like to make is that there were a great opportunities for both rich countries and people who came from poor areas. When people thinking to transfer abroad there were many reason but the most important when they want a chance to show of there craft and ability. Such as, Indian people they travelled many areas and they give them a lot of discoveries and skills; moreover, the rich countries need some people to help to make their country better place for living. For example, I have read an article in the newspaper they talked about development countries like UK, US and Arabic countries they need those people to improve their economy and life.
The second point, I will clarify is that there were many benefits when this countries allow jobs for those. They will be equality for all ;furthermore, there will be a improvement in living. For instance, I have saw a T.V decomontry they say "" In United States there are a equality and improvement in live between people they came from Africa
and citizens they help them to have good education, skills and experience also they contribute the US economy to growth "".
Finally, we can say that there were a opportunities and benefits for both sides. I am with this to have good life for all. I hope in the future poor countries they can take benefits from those people and developed their country to came better than now .",,,,,,5.0,"In my opinion, I agree that rich countries should offer jobs for skilled and knowledgeable workers from poor countries. Firstly, this type of opportunity allows talented people to have a better future and use their abilities in a way that makes a difference. For example, people from countries like Bangladesh or Nigeria often have good education and experience but not enough chances to work in their own country, so if they can go to places like Canada or Germany, they can improve their life and also help the new country grow. Secondly, allowing skilled workers from developing countries can be helpful for the rich country, too, because sometimes there is not enough local people to do important jobs. For instance, in the medical field, many hospitals in Australia or the UK hire doctors and nurses from India and the Philippines because they have the training and also are needed to help patients. Not only does this arrangement benefit the workers, but also the country that accepts them by making the economy stronger and more diverse. In the end, giving a chance for people with skills from poor countries to work in rich countries is good for everyone, and it makes the world more fair and connected."

Recently this trend has been more emphatic resulting in a disputable discussion which has been widely talked about. Should rich governments permit local workplaces to recruit foreign employees? I personally agree with this point of view and I will elaborate on the reasons in this essay.
There are several possible advantages of hosting employers from poor countries. First, foreign employees can bring with them new innovations and methods of research which in turn will enrich the local markets and possibly contribute to enhancing the knowledge. In addition, foreign employers are generally paid lower income in comparison to local workers, this could save up money for other investments. Moreover, a swarm of skilled immigrants will probably increase the competition among local employers and encourage them to improve in different aspect in order to secure employment.

Most of the foreign employers would utilize their occupation in the developed countries in improving their skills and knowledge and might consider going back to their homelands. This knowledge transfer would probably benefit both sides. As developed nations will employ the new comers and harness their experience in developing the education, health and other forms. Interestingly, this prosperity in developed countries will presumably lower the influx of unemployed and illiterate immigrants into the rich countries.

For example, many major technology companies in the United States have thrived due to the input of international engineers and scientists. Secondly, granting skilled workers access to better job opportunities allows them to develop their expertise, which can ultimately benefit their home countries if they decide to return. This process, known as “brain circulation,” helps spread advanced skills and technologies around the globe. Furthermore, allowing skilled migration can help fill gaps in the labor market that local workers cannot meet, such as shortages of doctors or engineers, thus supporting the overall economic growth of the host nation.

1179,2,"Write about the following topic:Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","The huge discrepancy between the rich countries and the poor ones is a constant of our society over the years. Although rich countries give financial supports to the poorer, it seems the problem of poverty is far from find a solution. Some people suggest to opt for other kinds of help. I partly agree with them, and I argue that financial skills and intellectual support should be integrated to the economical help the countries sent to the Third World.
Financial support is surely essential in order to help the poorer country to sane their situations. However, money without managment abilities are not useful enough. Indeed, governement of the so called Thrid World, since they do not possess managerial and investment's skills have no chance to make productive the money they used to receive. They can spend the money to solve the immediate issues they have to deal with without caring of the future perspective. For instance, nowadays countries used to send economical help to African countries. How do the poorer spend the money they receive? They built hospitals, schools and buy medicines and the primary necessity products they need. They cannot do more. This involve that as soon as the money and the resources they bought through them are finished, they cannot even mantain open hospitals and schools. They are again in poverty.
What then do the poorer country need? Economical support is not enough. They need also professional people who have to teach them the managerial skill they need. For the development of their countries, it is essential to understand how to invest the money and how to make more money starting from the support poorer used to receive. They cannot do this by themselves, rather they need to be guided through the contemporary economical attituted that the richer countries have been developing over the years. The idea just presented is confirmed by the fact that the countries of the Third World are used to be defined the richer at least from the natural resources they have. Nonetheless, they cannot be able to exploit the natural capital they posses because of their lack of skills. Tanzania, for instance, is a place full of interesting products. However, they have not specialised people able to interact with the richer country in order to start a business. To send money without teaching them how they can use them, it is the same as to give to a child a bycicle without teaching him how riding. Once, a child has learned the technique behind the riding, he will never be worth knowing how to do it.
In conclusion, I believe that countries should integrate the ""how to do"". In other words, althought money are an essential help in order to permit the survival of people in the poorer countries, it is important that those less-lucky countries improve their managerial skills to go out from poverty.",,,,,,6.5,"While financial aid from wealthy nations can provide temporary relief to poor countries, I believe that it is not a sufficient solution to the complex problem of poverty, and support should go beyond simply sending money. Handouts are often spent on urgent necessities, but as soon as the resources run out, the original issues resurface because the underlying causes are ignored. For instance, even though considerable funds have been transferred to various African countries, basic services like education and healthcare still struggle due to poor management and lack of infrastructure. From my perspective, developed countries should prioritize providing expertise, technology, and educational support. By investing in vocational training and sharing knowledge about agriculture, healthcare, or sustainable business practices, rich countries enable poorer nations to become more self-sufficient in the long term. An example is how some organizations supervise training programs for farmers in developing countries, resulting in better yields and improved livelihoods that persist long after financial aid would be depleted. In summary, while monetary help can address immediate needs, empowering people through education and skills training is much more effective for building lasting progress and helping poorer nations escape the cycle of poverty."

Some poor countries needs various types of help in order to develop themselfs. Educational help would have a major impact when associated with finantial help.
We can not interrupt the finantial help only by itself but we can ask for some accomplishments by the country which is receiving finantial help.
For example, a country would only receive next year finantial help if some rules or goals were accomplished by their government.
Educational infrastructres, help for children in school like aquiring IT equipment and the development of internet conection which in some countries there isn´t.
Books for children, meals during the school time would be very important, because it is trough education from very early that a country can develop itself.
Another example is in Agriculture field and environment. Frequently these countries have rudimentary forms of agricultre which demands old habits and dificult conditions for the farmers. A developed country when helping these countries, can also help with knowledgment, laws and protocols of agriculture. Today Agriculture has lots of technology helping farmers, businessmen and anyone linking with this area. Transmitting to these countries the tools and knowledge can also improve these countries to be more independent when we talk about agriculture. An organized agriculture department would mean less dependency of other coutries.
The environment is also a subject very important when talking about help to poor countries. It is a global issue, and these countries very often produce polluents. Transmiting them the importance in saving our planet it is a major goal. Again, knowledge, tools, forms of producing, technology can help not only the eficiency in the economy but also the environment. Transmitting the future generation the problems of our planet, the risks of global warming it is also a way to help.
Basically the help has to be individual, because the poor countries have their own singular problems, and so, we have to check individually those countries in order to help eficiently. Some countries have wars, other ones don´t even have organized governments. Other ones have organized governments and no wars but lack of basic needs such food, health and education. So it is important to not only help finantially but also dive in those countries individually on order to help efficiently.",,,,,,6.5,"While providing financial aid to developing countries can offer short-term relief, I agree that richer nations should prioritize other forms of assistance to truly address the roots of poverty. Financial contributions alone often do not reach those most in need, sometimes fostering dependency or even corruption. Instead, developed countries could make a more lasting impact by investing in the education and healthcare systems of poorer nations. For instance, supporting teacher training programs or helping build schools can empower local populations for generations, breaking the cycle of poverty through learning and opportunity. Similarly, providing access to modern medical equipment and training healthcare workers can dramatically improve quality of life. Another example is supporting sustainable agriculture by sharing advanced farming techniques and resources, allowing communities to feed themselves rather than rely on imported food. In my view, while monetary aid should not be stopped altogether, combining it with knowledge transfer, infrastructure projects, and capacity-building initiatives will enable poorer countries to stand on their own and create pathways to long-term prosperity."

Due to viruses, natural disasters, and poor management in the country and overpopulation, each day the poverty increases. In addition, some developed countries ignore the help or just give a temporary solution. Poverty has a great effect on the income that can lead to serious problems.
To begin with, developed countries shouldn't only support with financial aid, as that kind of solution will not help the people. In my opinion, rich countries can stop poverty in such way to look for the natural resources of the poor country and to help and develop its resources. For example, in Africa they are famous for their large area of land. A rich country can take this opportunity to implement a long-term plan to benefit and fight poverty, such as to start expanding the lands of agriculture to use their natural resources such as cocoa, rice, and coffee. Furthermore, this idea can also help the people of the country where they can work on the land and be employed.
Also, developed countries can donate and build health care centers and schools to prevent the dangerous disease from spreading. Schools can empower children to grow up and help the country's economy to rise and to fight poverty.
In conclusion, developed countries can unite and discuss this significant concern rather than helping with financial support as poverty is taking the lives of many children. Poor countries just need better solutions and understanding from the world to prevent such problems from continuing to happen.",,,,,,5.5,"There is no doubt that poverty remains a persistent issue in many parts of the world, and while developed countries have long provided financial aid to poorer nations, these efforts alone often fail to create lasting change. In my view, simply giving money does little to address the root causes of poverty, and it can sometimes even lead to dependence rather than progress. Instead, I believe that rich countries should focus on offering other forms of assistance, such as sharing technology, investing in education, and helping to build infrastructure. Take the example of countries like Bangladesh, where foreign investment in local industries has provided jobs and improved skills, leading to more sustainable development. When developed countries contribute by building hospitals, training teachers, or supporting clean water projects, these efforts create a foundation for long-term improvement in people’s lives. Financial aid might solve immediate problems, but by focusing on knowledge transfer and capacity building, the chances of breaking the cycle of poverty are much greater. In summary, while monetary support can help in emergencies, empowering poor countries through education, infrastructure, and technological support is a far more effective solution to reduce poverty over time."

For example, teaching modern farming techniques or offering vocational training helps people gain new skills, which can lead to stable employment and higher living standards. In addition, investment in clean drinking water, roads, or hospitals improves daily life and gives communities the tools to be self-reliant. Financial aid can sometimes be mismanaged or fail to reach those who need it most, but sharing expertise and resources leads to more sustainable results.

Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to unprivileged countries rather than financial aid.
I agree, for the most part, as we have seen from history, sadly the leaders of those countries aren't always thinking of helping their citizens with the money they got gifted. These world leaders could think of themselves first and satisfy themselves before they do anything else. Sometimes the world leaders don't help, after helping themselves they build their armies, and buy more weapons for more destruction. Before countries decide to help other countries with financial aid, they should analyze the world leader and see what type of world leader they could be. If the world leader shows any signs of selfishness, money won't help their citizens, it doesn't help with their situation at all. When the citizens find out their world leader isn't helping them with the financial aid, they could go violent and cause riots, revolutions, and a huge decrease in currency strength, which will increase poverty, homelessness, and famine.
On the other hand sending resources such as beverages, clothes, and books to help increase the number of educated people in the country would be far more useful. unfortunately, these types of countries have a problem with education among the citizens, many citizens want to educate themselves but aren't able to. Food and clothes help as well, many civilians don't have the privilege to warm themselves up, or get full. This will help with their quality of life.",,,,,,6.5,"In my opinion, I largely agree with the statement that wealthy countries should focus more on providing types of assistance other than just money to poorer nations. Although financial aid seems helpful on the surface, it often fails to address the root causes of poverty because it can be misused or not reach those who genuinely need it. For example, in some countries, donated funds are lost due to government corruption or are spent on projects that do not actually benefit the general population. Instead of giving only money, rich countries should prioritize support in areas like education, healthcare, and infrastructure. For instance, offering scholarships, teacher training, or building schools can improve education and help people escape poverty in the long term. Similarly, sending medical professionals or basic medical supplies can have a direct and positive impact on public health. Improved roads, access to clean water, and electricity can also dramatically enhance quality of life and open up economic opportunities. Overall, while financial aid can play a role, more practical support based on specific needs will have a stronger and more lasting effect on developing countries."

For this reason, some people state that people, including students need to learn cutting-edge technology, such as IT program outweigh the importance of learning history. Furthermore, they often state there is no value of learning history. Although some people's opinions are understandable to some extent, I strongly believe people continuously need to learn history to recognize modern social issues. I would like to state some reasons and examples to support my opinion.
Initially, people have a long history of how they improved their lifestyles drastically and violently from ancient times around the world. People kept fighting to increase their country's territory and caused innumerable victims. In addition, there were slaves who were occupied by invaders. As a result, they were often forced to move to another continent, such as America for the workforce and looked down on slaves. If people ignore learning this historical background, they will continue fighting and discriminating against them. Therefore, learning history will lead to how necessary to treat human rights equally.
Secondly, when it comes to the environment, there are several issues. Some disasters and global warming are triggered by human's sustainable long historical actions. After the Industrial Revolution that occurred in the 18th century, we consumed a lot of resources such as oil and coal, and the carbon dioxide emissions caused climate change such as global warming.
In addition, repeated deforestation led to floods and a sharp decline in native species. Unless people know the reason why such a revolution happened by history, people will take another action that is harmful to the global environment.
Finally, the causes of our modern society's problems as I mentioned above can be recognized by studying history. People need to take responsibility for a peaceful and eco-friendly society by considering a variety of views in history.",,,,,,6.0,"Many people today argue that learning about history has little significance in our fast-moving, modern world, where technological advancement and practical skills are highly valued. However, I disagree with this viewpoint, as I believe understanding the past is crucial for various aspects of our present lives. Firstly, history teaches us about the mistakes and successes of previous generations, which can help us avoid repeating harmful patterns. For instance, by studying the causes of wars and political conflicts in the past, societies can work towards more peaceful and diplomatic solutions today. Additionally, history provides context for current events and societal issues. For example, understanding the background of civil rights movements can help people appreciate the ongoing struggles for equality and motivate them to participate in positive social change. Furthermore, history shapes our cultural identity and fosters a sense of belonging and unity among people. If we neglect history, we risk losing valuable lessons and connections that give meaning to our lives. In summary, while new skills are important, learning about the past remains essential for both personal growth and the development of society as a whole."

However ,in the following essay i will discuss both arguments and highlight my opinion which side the notion that learning from past can bring alot of advantages to our life .
The general perception sets forth that past has gone and we as human beings live in present and look forward to move into the future . So looking behind us will not bring alot of benefits that can influence our life in a positive way , those people who believe in this rely on the facts that past will never repeat himself .Likewise , living in present and trying to learn from old stories has little values in a matter how to change the future .
However , personally i absolute disagree with this notion , and think that past can teach us many valuable lessons which can pave our future in way that we prohibit ourself to make same mistakes that our ancestors have done in past . For instance , by looking at the history of people in Europe ,we can see that during the earliest of twentieth century , people there went through a hostile conflict and as a result of that ,millions of lives have been lost as a price of anger and avarice . Afterwards , 100 years passed and nowadays people in Europe are taught to solve their problems away from violence and have a better understanding for their future .

While I understand the viewpoint that living in the present and preparing for the future is important, I firmly disagree with the idea that studying the past has no value. History not only helps us avoid repeating mistakes but also provides inspiration and guidance. For example, by examining instances of failed economic policies or wars, nations can learn to make better decisions and avoid similar tragedies. Personally, I have benefited from looking at my own family’s experiences, such as how my grandparents faced financial hardship and managed to build successful lives through perseverance and careful planning. These stories have inspired me to be more resilient and thoughtful. In conclusion, learning about the past offers countless lessons that can directly inform our actions in the present and help us build a better future, making it a valuable pursuit for everyone."

From my perspective, it is not true.

Undoubtedly, it has great advantages for the ones who need to progress in life, despite what they had been through, because to my opinion, greatest lessons in life come with our own experiences. Advantages of learning about the past are also on the side of the ones who personally know themselves very well and stay honest to themselves at all times.
For example, someone who try to be someone, acting to please influent people or trying to get somewhere he or she would not be able to if he were playing real, could be embarrassed by their own mistakes or feeling humiliated when looking back to what he accomplished to get where he/she is now ; therefore the past in this situation would not be a great option for him to look back after.
Despite this kind of personality, there are lots of people who find out constructive knowledge in looking back to the past, regardless of how great or bad it could be.
The kind of people who actually face their own past and do not try to hide it are the ones who are not scared of how people will judge them, but are willing to make greate changes in their future.

For instance, understanding the mistakes made in history, whether in politics, personal life, or even science, can help us avoid repeating them and make wiser decisions. If people ignore the past, there is a higher risk of making similar errors or overlooking opportunities for improvement. Even on a personal level, memories from our own lives can help guide us to make better choices—for example, a student who once failed an exam may study differently after reflecting on what went wrong. Of course, some people feel weighed down by their past or believe that it is better to only think about the present, but I believe that looking back honestly is a source of growth and strength. Therefore, I disagree with the idea that learning about the past has no value: it is, in fact, a crucial way for individuals and society to develop and achieve progress."

Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Is competition instructive or toxic for children? There is a debate around this topic. There are those who believe that a sense of competition should be supported. On the other standpoint, there are those who believe that rather that compete children have to learn how to co-operate. I believe that supporters of competicions are partly right but also that co-operation between children is essential. The two strategy can be taken together to give to childrens all the tools they need to became useful adults.
On the one hand, there are people who believe that to compete is essential for the growth of children. They believe that competitions rise the ambitions of children. They develop certain attitudes thanks to which they will have always bigger dreams and desire. The idea, therefore, is that children who have grown making competiions will became important managers because of their instinctive desire to be winners and successful persons. It is true that competitions permit childrens to develop their ambitions and to do the best they can in order to win. However, I strongly believe that a good understanding of the aim of competitions should be taught before they start to compete. Indeed, children have to understand the instructive role of competition and how manage the possible distructive consequences that could derive if a child is not ready to lose. Children should start a competition being aware of the possibility of lose and the possibility to win. I believe that is important to stimulate children in doing competitions but teaching them the important role of defeats and the role of coperation. This lead me to analyse the second standpoint.
There are, indeed, people who dislike competitions at all. They believe they are toxic for the growth of children. According to them, it is negative to teach children to be against between each other. Rather, children should learn how to work together and co-operate. Surely, co-operation is a vital skill in workplaces. The ability to work in team is one of the most searched by different businesses. To learn how to work together means for children to understand their role in a group and also to think about the ideas that should support the team itself. Co-operation then permits children to develop fundamental social skills. However, co-operation alone is not enough for children's instruction. I believe that co-operation is possible just if a child is also learning how to work and produce something alone. Children, in order to advances ideas and give a good support in a team, have to learn to be ambitious and this is possible thanks to competitions.
In conclusion, I believe that an instruction in which single competitions as well as team-works are encouraged is the most useful and productive in order to grow up efficient adults.",,,,,,6.5,"The question of whether children should be encouraged to compete or cooperate is widely discussed. On one side, some people argue that a sense of competition is important for children because it motivates them to work harder and achieve their goals. When children compete, they often push themselves to improve, learn how to deal with challenges, and develop a sense of pride in their accomplishments. For example, sports competitions can teach children discipline and resilience, both valuable traits in life. However, there is another viewpoint that cooperation leads to more useful adults. People in favor of cooperation believe that learning to work together is more important than winning or being the best. In today’s workplaces, being able to collaborate with others and appreciate different ideas is a key skill. Children who practice cooperation can become more understanding and better at solving problems as a group, which helps society as a whole. In my opinion, the best approach for raising children is a balance between competition and cooperation. Children can benefit from the drive that competition gives, but they should also understand the importance of supporting others and working together toward common goals. By teaching both values, we can help children grow into well-rounded and successful adults."

But, others think youngsters who were taught to share and be corporative will turn into helpful adults.
The sense of competition indeed can generate excitement and can push youngsters to give their best. On the other hand, the competitive feeling can cause hatred among children, especially if the parents were pressuring their child to always take the lead. For example, when I was nine years old I used to have a friend in my class that had a great sense of competition. She often caused problems when she lose or answered wrong. Unfortunately, the teacher got to know with the encouragement of her parents the girl felt pressured and the fear of disappointing them. In addition, parents can teach their children to co-operate and to engage with other youngster, to motivate them and to help them learn how to share, which can become a great experience when they get older and be more understanding and considerate.
However, a sense of competition is not always frustrating it can encourage a youngster to develop new behavior that can help them to discover adventurous journeys. Furthermore, being competitive among children might attract shy children to engage more and break the wall of fear.
In my opinion, teaching children to co-operate is far better than being competitive. It can improve children behaviour in positive way.

However, too much competition can also make children anxious or develop negative feelings towards others if they feel they always need to win. On the other hand, learning to cooperate with others helps children become more supportive, patient, and understanding adults. When children work together on group projects, they learn how to communicate and solve problems as a team, which can be a valuable skill in adulthood. In my view, cooperation is more important because it teaches children kindness and helps them build positive relationships. To sum up, while competition can bring some benefits, I believe encouraging cooperation makes children more balanced and helpful adults in the long run."

Some people hold that adolescents should be encouraged to compete, while others disagree and argue that teaching children to work together is more important. This essay will analyse both positions and illuminate my standpoint.
As for those highlighting the importance of competition, these people may have their position grounded upon the fact that children can learn a lot by competing against each other, especially when they encounter numerous obstacles brought by their strong opponents and suffer failures. Only under such adverse conditions can children understand their drawbacks and the ways of improvement. Apart from that, if children have hard-earned victories over competent rivals, they are likely to gain tremendous pleasure of success as well as huge confidence that motivates them to keep working diligently and achieve more success.
On the contrary, in terms of those attaching greater importance to cooperation than to competition, these people may justify their position by citing a large number of examples elucidating the role of collaboration in various tasks, such as the production of a high-tech gadget of which the parts are manufactured by different countries, and a formal meeting where people present their respective views on a given issue in order to comprehenively understand the situation. Admittedly, these examples sufficiently explain the importance of cooperation. However, this does not mean that cooperation must outweigh competition since the two ways of interaction influence us differently and it is rather impractical to identify which one is more influential to us.
To sum up, competition and cooperation benefit us in different ways. It is hardly possible to conclude which one is more important to us.",,,,,,8.5,"There is an ongoing debate about the best approach to raising well-rounded children, with some advocating for promoting a sense of competition, while others emphasize the significance of teaching cooperation instead. Proponents of competition suggest that when children are encouraged to compete, they strive to exceed their own limits, developing perseverance and a strong work ethic that can help them succeed later in life. Such a mindset can inspire children to set personal goals and learn from their failures, which are valuable lessons both in academic settings and in the professional world. By contrast, supporters of cooperation believe that instilling collaborative skills in children better prepares them for adulthood because most real-life tasks require effective teamwork and the ability to compromise with others. This view is supported by examples from workplaces, where the most successful projects often depend on group efforts and the harmonious combination of individual strengths. Personally, I believe that both competition and cooperation have important roles to play in children's development. Encouraging a healthy level of competition can push children to excel, but it should be balanced with opportunities for cooperation to ensure they are socially adaptable and capable of working well within a team. Therefore, a balanced approach that incorporates both competition and cooperation is likely to be the most beneficial for preparing children to be successful, useful adults."

This essay will demonstrate that teaching the sense of cooperation is the correct way to raise a child, so she will be more useful because it instigates kindness, which makes a healthier individual and a more inclusive society, thus, creating a healthier community.
Although we live in a very competitive world, the constant race for power, a better position corrode the sense of being kind. Every person around becomes a foe, an adversary to be defeated.

Those who favor competition argue that it motivates children to strive for excellence and prepares them for the challenges of the modern world, where standing out can mean securing better educational or job opportunities. On the other hand, supporters of cooperation maintain that when children learn to work together, they develop empathy and social skills that are essential for solving complex problems in adult life. From my perspective, encouraging cooperation provides greater advantages because most significant accomplishments in life require collaboration rather than solo achievements. For instance, in my own school experience, group projects taught me how to listen to others’ ideas, resolve disagreements, and contribute to a shared goal, skills that have been extremely valuable in both academic and personal settings. While a healthy sense of competition can sometimes inspire improvement, overemphasizing it often breeds jealousy or hampers teamwork. Therefore, teaching children the importance of cooperating with others is likely to result in adults who are not only productive but also supportive members of society."

On the other hand, others believe that cooperation is a more valuable trait for children to develop, as it fosters teamwork, understanding, and empathy. When children learn to work together, they not only become better communicators, but they are also better equipped to solve problems and handle conflicts in adulthood. In my view, while a certain level of healthy competition can spur growth, teaching children to cooperate is ultimately more beneficial. For example, in my school, group assignments often led to creative solutions and stronger friendships, demonstrating how collaboration can lead to better outcomes. Therefore, I believe that encouraging cooperation lays the foundation for a more compassionate and productive society."

There is a debate conserning the activities that should be porsued during the free time. There are people who think that it is important to enrich mind with cultural activities such as reading books and doing word puzzles. On the other hand, there are those who suggest that leisure time is made to relax the mind. I believe that a balance between the two extreme views is the better solution.
It is very important to give to coltivate our mind with culture. Reading a book, listen to classical musing, play games in which problem solving tricks should be sold is a funny way to spend your time and at the same time exercise the brain. To spend 15 minutes playing a game in which you have to solve math problems or doing world puzzles can be considered as the mental counterpart of the physical workout. To read a book had always been considered as the best way to learn without studying. Another interesting way in which the brain should be trained is by playing an instruments. To focus on some activities that will encourage the development of your skills and more stimuli on your brain is surely one of the best way to spend a part of your leisure time.
On the other hand, it is also important to rest. Also your brain need a break. While it is easy to rest your body by sitting on the sofa it is not equally easy to stop your brain and to give to it a break. Listening to classical music, listening to the sounds of the nature, to have a nice walk, do meditations are some ways in which you can rest your mind. Even if it will be time in which the brain is on pause, some positive effect will be noted. Indeed, after only 30 minutues the brain will be recharged and full of energy.
In conclusion, I believe that a balance between intellectual activities and total rest of the brain will be the best solution to give to the mind both stimuli and time to recharge itself. Although the positive effects that will be obtained by spending leisure time in activities that improve the mind, the brain like a computer need sometimes to be put in a standby mode, even if just for a very brief period.",,,,,,7.0,"People often have different views on how best to spend their free time, especially when it comes to caring for their minds. Some believe that leisure hours provide an ideal opportunity to engage in activities that make the mind sharper, such as reading new books, attempting crossword puzzles, or even learning a new language. These people argue that, similar to how the body benefits from regular exercise, the mind also needs continuous challenges to remain healthy and active. For example, I have a friend who regularly does sudoku and says it helps him stay focused at work. On the other hand, there are those who think it is just as important, or perhaps even more so, to let the mind relax during leisure time. They point out that life is often stressful and that constantly keeping the mind active can lead to mental exhaustion. Watching a light-hearted movie, taking a walk, or simply sitting quietly can help the brain recover from daily pressures. Personally, I believe that the most beneficial approach is a mixture of both viewpoints. It can be very rewarding to spend some of one’s leisure time on hobbies that stretch the mind, but it is also necessary to take breaks and rest, so as not to be overwhelmed. In the end, balancing stimulating activities with moments of relaxation seems, to me, the best way to ensure long-term mental well-being."

i strongly against what some people think that rest the mind through
listening to music for example or watch TV. can compensate reading and bring comfort to the brain .
although we all as human beings need to enjoy some moments with
friends , doing some physical activities like sport , dance and spend some time with family lingering in resturants , public parks and gather at night around TV. there is understanding that some of our free time should be spend on reading and playing mind games that rely on our focus to solve some tricky problems. in fact excercises given to our brain by reading and solving puzzles consider as main factor that keep our brain to work perfectly throught out the day ,
furthermore reading for example will bring more knowledge to us and ultemately more education and better understanding to our surroundings , reading will open minds and accept differences which settle our minds in peace , in the same way doing puzzle games will provide more training to our mind encourage our brain to face bigger problems in our lives.

Supporters of mentally stimulating activities say that reading and similar hobbies help keep the brain sharp and can help prevent mental decline, especially as people get older. From my own experience, reading books during my free time has not only made me more knowledgeable, but it has also helped me think more clearly about complex issues. On the other hand, those who favor relaxation say that after a busy or stressful day, the last thing people need is more work—even if it is mental. They believe that watching a favorite show, chatting with friends, or engaging in restful hobbies helps recharge mental energy and prevent burnout. Personally, I think both perspectives have merit, but I believe balance is key. Engaging in activities like reading or puzzles can be very rewarding and beneficial, but it is equally important to recognize when the mind needs to rest to maintain overall well-being. For example, after an intense week at school, I find that spending part of my weekend on a relaxing walk or just listening to music does wonders for my mood and motivation. In conclusion, while improving the mind is a valuable use of leisure time, everyone should listen to their own needs and make time for rest as well as mental enrichment."

There is ongoing debate, however, about whether this precious free time should be spent on activities that stimulate the mind, like reading or solving puzzles, or whether it should be used strictly for relaxation and mental rest. On one side, advocates for mental engagement during leisure suggest that consistently exercising the brain can foster sharper thinking, creativity, and even guard against cognitive decline. Activities such as learning a new language, doing crosswords, or reading non-fiction not only provide entertainment but also expand a person's knowledge and perspective, which can be advantageous in both personal and professional arenas. Conversely, supporters of resting the mind argue that modern life is already mentally taxing and relentless, making it essential to truly unwind during downtime. Taking gentle walks, listening to calming music, or simply sitting quietly are ways to grant the mind a necessary break, allowing stress levels to decrease and mental fatigue to subside. These practices can result in heightened focus and renewed energy once it's time to return to work or complex tasks. In my view, the ideal use of leisure time strikes a balance between these approaches. It is important to listen to one's own needs—sometimes engaging the mind can be invigorating and restorative, while at other times, intentional rest may be the best medicine. Ultimately, choosing how to spend leisure time should reflect personal circumstances, interests, and the current demands of life, ensuring both mental growth and well-being."

How should we deal with this problem?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In the last years the problem of global warming is becaming more and more debated. One of the main causes of the temperature rising are men-made activities. Almost all the activities made by humans produce a huge impact on the natural environment. For instance, some of the usual activities made daily by people are impacting. Indeed, the chemical products they buy and use as well as the ways of trasportation's abuse can be annoverated among the main reasons for global warming. Lastly, even if it is the more impacting, there is the industral system and their production of slags.
The first impact made by men-activities concerns the product they use. There are at least three kinds of products that may cause the rising of temperature. First, there are products like lacquaer and foam. Because they were beed uncontrolled used during the last decades, they have been one of the main causes of the Ozone Hole. Spray products, even if they are just suncream or hair conditionars could be very impacting because of their chemical composition. Another men-activity that impact a lot on the environment concern their use of the way of transportation. Indeed, the abuse of private ways of trasportation caused an increasement of pollution and a dramatic increase of the level of petrol in the environment. Petrol is not only one of the main reason for global warming but also the first responsible for sea's pollution. Furthermore, the dayly use of flight cause pollution in the air and now restriction on the abuse of this way of trasportation are trying to be a kind of solution to the problem.
Lastly, one of the main causes of global temperatures higher is the industrial system. Indeed, they used to point to the cheaper solution to produce and eliminate the radioactive waste. The problem of a prodaction that does not take care of the environment pointed to use polluting products and machines. Furthermore, the industrial system point to produce more and more causing the waste of energy and raw materials. For instance, the fashion industry is one of the more pulluting in the world. It abuses of materials and energies whithout caring abuut the waste of them. Finally, the problem of the way in which the industries procede in elimnating waste is crucial. Indeed, in the last years they used to disperse the waste on the sea. This tendecy was increased for two reasosns: saving and speed. These are the two eassential words of industrial system.
In conclusion, I think there are two main reasons that cause the raising of global temperatures that can be annoverated among the others. Those that concern the personal and daily activities of men (use of determinate products and ways of trasportation) and then those activities operate by the industrial system.",,,,,,6.0,"There is much discussion today about how human actions are making temperatures on the earth warmer. The biggest cause of this problem is the way people use energy and resources. First, using cars and other vehicles that run on petrol or diesel releases gases like carbon dioxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere and make the planet warmer. Second, many factories and power plants use coal or oil to create energy, and they also send a lot of pollution into the air. I have noticed in my own city that air pollution from cars and factories makes the air difficult to breathe, especially in the summer when it feels hotter than before. Another cause is the cutting down of trees in forests to create space for farms or new buildings. Trees help absorb carbon dioxide, so when they are gone, more gas stays in the air. To deal with this problem, people should use public transportation more often and choose cleaner energy, like solar and wind power, instead of relying on coal and oil. Governments can also make laws to protect forests and encourage companies to make less pollution. In conclusion, human habits are responsible for rising global temperatures, but with some smart changes and careful use of resources, it is still possible to protect our planet for the future."

How should we deal with this problem?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Two centuries ago, when people celebrated the evolutionary development brought by industrialization, no one would ever anticipate that a profound change of global climate would be caused by the “machines” humans had made. However, many ecologists point out that human activities have put a massive burden on the ecosystem, which leads to increasingly higher global temperatures. This essay will explain the major causes of global climate change, followed by several plausible solutions.
It has been widely recognized that excessive greenhouse gas emissions are the culprit of global climate change, and burning fossil fuels and consuming oil are the leading causes of greenhouse gas emissions. First, our daily life in a modern society heavily relies on electricity, acquired mainly through burning fossil fuels like coal. A colossal amount of smoke, predominantly carbon dioxide, is released during this process. As a result, the smoke captures excessive heat on the Earth, resulting in an increase in global temperatures. Second, consuming oil impacts global temperatures in the same way. As the energy from burning fossil fuels cannot meet the rapidly growing needs, more and more oil extraction programs are set up to acquire petroleum. The process of both drilling oil and consuming it creates a significant amount of greenhouse gases. Thus, burning fossil fuels and consuming oil are significant causes of climate change.
However, although lowering greenhouse gas emissions is challenging, several actions could decelerate the effect. One major step is to urge the energy-dependent companies to reduce productivity and create more jobs in green industries. Like large cloth manufacturers, giant companies need a significant portion of energy to keep their machines running every day. By reducing productivity, the amount of energy they need can drop. At the same time, the government should increase investment in green industries to maintain a healthy employment rate. On the other hand, individuals can make their own contribution by reducing their personal carbon footprints. Every small step, such as turning off the lights when leaving home, taking public transportations instead of driving cars, or simply eating less meat, can make big changes.
In conclusion, the excessive greenhouse gas emissions released mainly by burning fossil fuels and consuming oil have caused an alarming increase in global temperatures. Nevertheless, this problem could be alleviated by a collective effort of giant companies and individuals.",,,,,,8.0,"Over the past few decades, there has been a notable rise in global temperatures, and scientific research largely attributes this trend to a range of human activities. A primary reason for this phenomenon is the extensive use of fossil fuels in transportation, power generation, and industry. When coal, oil, or natural gas are burned, they emit substantial levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and disrupting the balance of the planet’s climate system. Another significant contributor is deforestation. When forests are cleared to make way for agriculture or urban development, not only is the earth deprived of trees that absorb carbon dioxide, but the process itself often releases additional carbon into the air. Agricultural practices and industrial livestock farming also release potent greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide, further exacerbating the warming effect. Addressing this urgent problem calls for a multifaceted approach involving both systemic changes and personal responsibility. Governments can play a crucial role by implementing stricter regulations on emissions, investing in renewable energy sources like wind and solar, and encouraging the use of public transportation. Moreover, individuals can help reduce the demand for carbon-intensive products by choosing energy-efficient appliances, conserving electricity, and adopting more sustainable diets. Through a combined effort involving policy reforms and changes in personal behavior, it is possible to slow the trend of rising global temperatures and protect the environment for future generations."

The main causes of temperature rising is human-made things. First, many people use air-conditional in summer and this can make glaciers melting. There is a study that too much uses of air-conditional are melting the glaciers. When the glaciers melt, the earth temperatures raise 4'C. In addition, nowadays, many people use cars when they go out. This can be a cause of rising temperature. This is because when we use cars, it spread the exhaust gas which influence to the air and temperatures.

The most common reason for this is the pollution from factories and vehicles. When factories produce things, they often burn coal or oil which makes smoke that goes into the sky. This smoke, which people call greenhouse gas, stays around the earth and traps the heat. Also, when people drive cars or use buses too much, these also put out exhaust gas which can make the problem worse. For example, in my city, there are many cars on the road every day, and sometimes we can even smell the pollution in the air. To solve this problem, we should try to use less electricity and drive less. People can take bicycles or walk for short trips, or use public transportation like buses and trains. Factories can also be made to use clean energy like solar or wind, which does not make greenhouse gas. If everyone helps, like turning off lights when not needed or carpooling, this big problem of rising temperatures will get better. In conclusion, humans are causing the earth to warm up, but with smart changes in our daily life and better ways of making energy, we can protect our earth for the future."

The causes of making temperatures higher can be for various reason, but rencently there is a growing evidence that man-made activties are causing it. Man-made activites such as pollution can be one of the causes. Nowadays, we must focus on how we can deal with them and solbe the problem. This essay will include the causes and the solution on why our earth temperature is increasing.
At first, we are polluting the earth without realizing the threats or problems that this can cause in the future, that is because of the unawarness of our society. One of the main causes of the rising temperatures is factories. Factories production can cause severe air pollution, because of the burning waste or by blowing air that include chemicals out to the fresh air. The current rise of temperature is alarming. Deforestation is another reasons to this problem. Deforestation is caused by humans to sell it or use for our own benefit, but in reality we are killing planet earth.
To every problem there are solution. Since we are already in this problem; we better find a solution before it is too late. Even though there are man-made activites that are causing the problem, but there are some that can solve it. The introduction of electronic car is the beginning of the solution, where the use of diesel are decreased to make our vehicles more eco-friendly. As we can see today, restaurants and cafes are serving plastic straws; even though, this will not solve the problem immediately, but it is a good start to make our life more friendly to our environment.
In conclusion, global warming is a serious issue that must not be avoided. Although, we did put ourselves in this position, but we will also be able to fix it. The causes that drove us to this problem are used for a long time. However, reducing the amount of factory production or introducing eco-friendly machinery can be our way out.",,,,,,6.0,"The increase in global temperatures is a challenge facing the entire world, and there is clear evidence that human actions are a leading cause.

Additionally, cutting down trees, also known as deforestation, contributes to the problem because trees help absorb carbon dioxide. If we do not control these actions, global temperatures will keep rising and cause dangerous weather patterns, damage to wildlife, and problems for farmers. To address this issue, we should use more renewable energy sources like solar and wind power instead of oil and gas, and governments should encourage people to use public transport or electric cars. Planting more trees can also help capture carbon from the air. For example, in my city, there has been a campaign to plant trees and promote the use of bicycles, which shows that local actions can make a difference.

This essay will discuss the main causes of temperature rising including the excessive use of fossil fuels and plastic pollution. This essay will further suggest solutions to these problems including decreasing the consumption of fossil fuels and reducing the dumping of waste in the sea.
Most people are guzzling fossil fuels, churning out greenhouse gases and messing with our planet's climate like there's no tomorrow. For instance, driving to the grocery store burns a certain amount of fuel, resulting in an increase in carbon footprint. The combustion of fossil fuels emits CO2, which in turn traps heat in the atmosphere, hence making it the primary contributor to global warming. Moreover, dumping plastic in oceans deprive phytoplanktons of sunlight. As a result, the planktons are not able to carry out photosynthesis, a process that removes CO2 and releases oxygen, which leads to disruption of the world's carbon cycle and ultimately makes the planet warmer. Thus human activities that contribute to an escalation in CO2 emissions are the prime causes of a rise in global temperature.
Substituting fossil fuels with other renewable energy sources and reducing plastic usage are both critical to mitigating this phenomenon. For example, people should install solar lights in their homes instead of Led bulbs. We should also curb the buying of processed or canned foods and should always take our own paper bags while going  grocery shopping to prevent the use of plastic bags. Furthermore, using public transportations rather than private vehicles for commuting would significantly alleviate our carbon footprint. Therefore, if humans shift to renewable and recyclable materials then it would drastically minimise the temperature rising issues.
To conclude, people's actions that change the environment have a negative impact on the global climate. However, we can substantially lessen it by curbing fossil fuels and plastic usage.",,,,,,8.0,"The increase in Earth's average temperatures can be largely attributed to human activities, particularly those that release greenhouse gases into our atmosphere. The primary culprits include burning fossil fuels for electricity and transportation, which sends enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the air, and deforestation, which reduces the planet’s capacity to absorb CO2. For instance, vast forests in places like the Amazon are being cut down for agriculture and logging, and this not only destroys plant life that could help absorb emissions, but also adds yet more CO2 when trees are burned or left to rot. To tackle this urgent challenge, we need both collective and individual actions. Governments ought to promote renewable energy like wind and solar, and create strict regulations that limit emissions from industries and vehicles. On a personal level, individuals can save energy by using public transportation, recycling, or conserving electricity at home. A neighbor of mine, for example, installed solar panels on his roof and now rarely relies on coal-generated power. By making these changes widespread, people can drastically decrease the rate at which temperatures are rising, making the planet a healthier place for current and future generations."

There are a number of arguments that can support my stance. To begin with, it is impossible to enroll equal genders of students in every subject. It is true that some faculties are underrepresented by a particular gender. For example, STEM subjects usually have more male students than females, but the opposite is true in educational-related subjects, which phenomenon seems to violate the principle that we fight endeavor today, gender equality. Therefore, people want to accept equal numbers of students to achieve a gender balance in every subject. However, the reality is that different genders prefer to study different subjects themselves, but not because of the unequal opportunity. According to one of the research, women show a higher interest in subjects like education, psychology and arts rather than science-related subjects. As a result, it is apparent that admitting equivalent proportions of male and female students can hardly be achieved.
In addition, it will deprive students of chances to make their own choices if universities enroll both genders equally in every subject mandatorily. It should be noted that it is students' right to select the subjects freely in college. If students cannot register for the subjects they want to study just because there are not enough quotas left for particular gender of students, or they are forced to study some subjects they are not interested in just because they need to fulfill the gender requirement in the class, it will hinder students' learning in the long-run.
To conclude, universities should not enroll equal gender students in every subject as it is impossible to achieve and may deprive students the freedom to choose the major they want to study.",,,,,,7.0,"Although some believe that universities ought to guarantee an equal number of male and female students in every academic discipline, I do not agree with this approach. Firstly, enforcing strict gender quotas fails to recognize the natural variation in student interests between genders, which is often shaped by upbringing, culture, and individual preference rather than institutional bias. For example, more women currently choose to study nursing and education, whereas males are typically drawn to mechanical engineering and computer science. If universities were to impose rigid gender ratios, it might result in capable and motivated applicants being denied entry simply to fill a quota, which seems both unfair and inefficient. Moreover, education should be about enabling students to follow their passions, not about meeting arbitrary targets that may ignore personal ambitions and abilities. Real gender equality should focus on ensuring all students receive the same opportunities and encouragement, rather than restricting enrollment based on gender. In sum, I believe that while universities should work to eliminate all forms of discrimination, mandating the same number of male and female students in every subject is neither practical nor just."
1231,2,Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Some people believe that educational facilities must accept the same numbers of men as women in every subject. There are both pros and cons in this argument, which will be discussed in this essay.
A tremendous number of people think that equality is crucial for education. Nowadays, more and more activists fight for women's rights. They want that every female can study everything that she prefers, notwithstanding this is socially acceptable or not. Moreover, many feminists suggest that patriarchal societies do not allow women to study equality with men. For example, when a little boy says to his younger sister that she is not intelligent enough for the men's play, a little girl grows up and thinks that she cannot study men's subjects and work men's jobs. Therefore, the main reason to accept equal numbers of both sexes is to crush many stereotypes about women's intellectual abilities and allow them to choose which subject they really want to study.
On the other hand, some people can complain that this is discrimination against men. For instance, if every university will accept only 50% of men with the highest grades in every subject, men with average grades but higher than women's will not be accepted. Furthermore, this idea does not guarantee that all wise women will study in universities. Females also can do not want to learn every existing subject.
In conclusion, the main point of equality in education is about choice, not coercion. From my point of view, that would be great if male and female students could study the same subjects; if more boys prefer to be teachers, while more girls like to be scientists. However, this is impossible when a lot of stereotypes exist, and the coercion of universities to accept balanced numbers of students based on their genders does not help solve the global issue with equality.",,,,,,7.0,"The question of whether universities should admit equal numbers of male and female students in every subject is a matter of much debate. Some believe that achieving such balance is necessary to ensure fairness and break down gender stereotypes that have historically prevented women and men from pursuing certain fields. For instance, ensuring more women are admitted to engineering programs could encourage greater female participation in a profession traditionally dominated by men, and this may help gradually change perceptions about who can succeed in these areas. However, others point out several practical issues with enforcing strict gender quotas. Admissions should be based on merit and interest, not arbitrary numbers, and some subjects naturally attract more students of one gender than another. For example, nursing programs often have more female applicants, while computer science courses draw in more males, reflecting both societal influences and individual preferences. Trying to impose equal numbers might unintentionally exclude deserving candidates simply because of their gender, rather than their abilities or passion for the subject. In my opinion, while gender equality is important, universities should focus on creating opportunities for all students and removing barriers to entry, instead of mandating exact gender ratios in every subject. Ultimately, real progress will come from changing attitudes and encouraging diverse participation, not from strict numerical equality."
1233,2,Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Regarding education, gender equity is crucial. Some people argue that universities should enrol an equal number of men and women in every field. Personally, I totally agree with that statement because I believe it is fairer and it is better for the society.
The main reason male and female students should be equal in number is that it would be more equitable. In fact, numerous studies have stated that their brains are not working the same way. In other words, their cognitive capacities are different, so they should not compete with each other for university admissions. It does not mean that a gender is more intelligent than the other. For example, men are generally known to have a better spacial orientation, while women's ability to memorize is superior. Similarly, their physical capacities are not the same either, and that is why men and women do not compete against each other in sports competitions.
Another reason to separate sexes regarding university admissions is because it ensure a better distribution of gender among the labor market. Broadly speaking, it is well known that males work, in their life, more hours that females. This is principally due to the fact that women take more maternity leave than men. Unfortunately, it can consequently create a problem in the society.For example, nowadays, women represent the majority of students in medicine as they have better grades in high school. As a result, there is not enough working staff in hospitals when they quit to take care of their families. The same situation applies to every field with a majority of women such as jobs in health services.
In conclusion, I reiterate that there should be an equal number of male and female students enrolled in universities because it would be more equitable and ensure a better repartition of genders among different fields of employment.",,,,,,7.0,"Ensuring gender balance in university admissions is a nuanced issue. While some believe that every subject should have the same number of male and female students, I only partly agree with this approach, because quality and interest should also be factors. On one hand, equal gender representation can support inclusivity and break down traditional barriers, especially in fields like engineering or nursing where one gender is typically underrepresented. This might also help promote role models for future generations and lead to a more balanced workforce, as I have seen in my own experience with classmates who felt encouraged to pursue non-traditional fields due to visible gender diversity. However, enforcing strict gender quotas might sometimes limit the opportunities for the most passionate and qualified candidates, regardless of gender. People have different interests and strengths, so natural variations will probably always exist. Ultimately, while encouraging more equal numbers can be beneficial, universities should focus primarily on merit and genuine enthusiasm for the subject rather than imposing mandatory gender parity in every faculty."
1235,2,Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Nowadays, universities are accepting all the students, as many men as women in every subject matter. I believe that being open to all students is fair. The university must allow everyone to study what is interesting for each individual, regardless of gender.
However, I think that the numbers of equality in each course are statistically speaking unrealistic. Even though, in general, I completely agree that there must be equality and human rights.
Nowadays, many are the organizations created, to support equality, sex discrimination, with the aim of helping people to get their rights. However, despite enormous positive changes compared to the past, still, some people reckon that some jobs are for women and others for men. What does it even mean? Should a woman only do house chores and raise kids? As can be seen, based on women's experience, a woman can be a businesswoman and a great mother at the same time. There is an old saying, 'Give me an educated mother and I will give you an educated nation'. Therefore, I disagree with some people's beliefs. Men and women can be great in different jobs and positions.
However, having the same number of students in each course is impractical for universities. Realistically speaking, there are some courses which attract more one gender than the other. In terms of numbers, if we think that, for instance, in the nursery degree there is 50 % of females and, then the other half will be waiting to be filled form males, it would be harsh for the university to close the course with the same parity of future students.
In a nutshell, universities should not accept only one gender for a particular course or most of that gender with a fixed number. As the applications arrive at the university, they should select people based on their skills, knowledge, and merits. No matter if the course will be 80% females and 20% male or vice versa.",,,,,,6.0,"Personally, I do not believe that universities should be required to admit equal numbers of male and female students in every subject, because this expectation does not take into account individual interests or the reality of varying application rates between genders. In my view, admission should not be based on gender quotas, but instead on each applicant’s qualifications and genuine passion for the subject. For example, in my own experience at university, I noticed that certain fields such as engineering tend to have more male applicants, while programs like nursing and education often attract more females. This is not necessarily due to unfairness but rather different preferences and career goals. Forcing equal numbers could lead to admitting less motivated or less prepared students, which may not be beneficial for anyone. Of course, I agree that universities must ensure equal opportunity and guard against discrimination, so everyone has a fair chance to pursue any subject they like. However, the idea of enforcing strict gender balance in every field is not only impractical, but it could also overlook the unique talents and desires that individuals bring, regardless of their gender. It is better to encourage interest and support both men and women in all subject areas without restricting admissions to fulfill an artificial quota."
1237,2,Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Pollution free environment is important for our life's health and even enjoyement.
Everyone whether an individual or large entitiy has an impact on the environment; regardless whether it was good or bad. Hence, I believe it is the responsibility of individulas as well as governments and large companies.
Individuals can do a lot to improve the environemt around them starting with taking some actions to make a difference. For example, every memeber in the sociaty can support recycling efforts by sorting their garbages into different categoreis, instead of wasting the efforts of recycling companies to do so. Another exmaple would be to stop using plastic products and replace them with more environemt friendly products like pepar products.
Moreover, teaching and spreading awarness about the importance of keeping our environemt clean are another way to make a difference. For instance, we can use social media to spread awarness and start campaigns about enviorment and pollution. Furthermore, we can teach some classes in schools and universities about this subject. As a result, this will help the upcoming generations to understand the problem and have them continue the efforts of improvement.
While individuals efforts are essential, they must be supported by governments and large companies in order to complete the circle. A main example here would be establishing regulations and laws that would minimze the damage to the environment and maintain pollution at low levels, which is the role of the governments around the world. As for large companies, they can support by adopting the best practicies and take the proper actions to reduce pollution and improve the environment. As an example, they can start using clean and renewable energies to power their facilities and plants. In addition, those companies can develop technologies that contributes toward keeping the environment safe, and prompet the use of clean energy and vehicales.
To sum up, the responsibility to improve the environemt must be divided between all three parties individuals, governments, and large companies. Each has his role to enhnace the environemnt and reduce the pollution. They complete each other and they should work together toward a better future for our world.",,,,,,6.5,"Many people believe that only governments and powerful companies are able to make a real difference when it comes to improving the environment, but I completely disagree with this idea. While it is true that large groups can implement broad changes, individuals also have an essential role to play in protecting the planet. For example, when people choose to use public transportation or ride a bicycle instead of driving a car, they help reduce air pollution and traffic congestion. Similarly, individual actions like conserving water, recycling household waste, and planting trees in local parks can collectively add up to significant positive impacts. Schools, families, and even neighborhoods can work together on environmental projects, showing that change can start on a small scale and grow. In addition, personal choices as consumers—such as buying eco-friendly products or supporting sustainable brands—can pressure companies to become more environmentally friendly. Of course, government policies and corporate strategies are necessary for managing large-scale environmental challenges, but these solutions often depend on the willingness of ordinary people to cooperate and adopt new behaviors. In conclusion, I believe that everyone must share the responsibility to care for the environment, and that individuals, through their daily decisions and actions, contribute just as much as large organizations to the overall well-being of our planet."

Imperoving the environment is the duty of each and every living being living in the society, only governments and large companies together cannot make any difference. if all the parties get united as one anything can be done to improve the environment.
The writer disagrees with the statement than agrees. Environmental pollution, enviornmental degredations have shown a rapid increase in the past few years. The main reason to this disaster is that people have become more selfish and keep on passing the ball to other people saying that it is their responsibilty and not ours. Based on a recent research conducted by a group of Researchers in The United States of America, they have concluded that the most damages to the surrounding is caused by the activites done by humans.
in writers opinion, there are few steps that can be taken to improve the environment. The main step is, supporting 3-R system, that is reduce, reuse and recycle. If we could promote this system, environment can be uplifted, because there will be less amount of wastage. Secondly, volunteer cleaning programms in the society can be brought up together with education systems to the community about how to keep your environment clean. These are the some of the main things that can be done to uplift the environment.

I believe that individual people can make a big contribution too, even though their actions might seem small compared to those of larger groups. For example, when individuals choose to use less plastic or pick up litter, they are reducing pollution in their neighborhoods. If many people make these kinds of environmentally friendly choices, the positive effects can quickly add up. Of course, governments and companies have more resources and can create bigger changes, like developing renewable energy and making stricter pollution laws. However, these big changes will work better if normal people support them by following the rules and making green choices at home. In my opinion, everyone has a part to play in caring for the environment, and real improvement happens when individuals, companies, and governments all work together toward the same goal."

Although government and large companies have a huge impact on the environment, I totally disagree with the previous argument and I believe that each individual can help improving the environment.
Our environment is our resposibility, it is not only subjected to government or large companies.
In fact, I believe that each individual has his or her own duty toward the environment. If any individual throw any kind of waste on the streat, this will have a huge impact on the environment. if someone throw a plastic bottel for example, it might take thousands of years for the plastic to resolve. Instead people should have the knowledge about where they should throw their waste and always look for a recycle baskets. People should be aware about how harmful it is to the environment if they throw their waste elsewhere.
Other possible way for individuals to help improving the environment is by using recycable materials, for example paper bags instead of plastic bags. This attitude will encourage recycling. Another example of emproving environment by individuals is driving electrical mobiles ratherthan old cars and trucks. This way the toxic emissions will be reduced and that will help our atmosphere and prevent global warming.
In conclusion, the improvement of our environment is in our hands, each individual has the resposibility of this planet and should act according to this. we cannot just blame the government or the companies. specially if we are not attempting to do our easy part.",,,,,,6.5,"Some people think that only governments and huge corporations have the power to really make a difference for the environment, but I do not agree with this point of view. While these organizations do play an important role in protecting the environment, I believe that individual action is just as crucial. For example, if every person tried to reduce their use of plastic, the demand for plastic products would decrease and companies would have to pay attention. Small changes in people’s daily habits, like using reusable shopping bags or turning off lights when not needed, can add up to a large collective impact. In addition, when many individuals choose to support businesses that care about the environment, such as by buying products made of recycled materials, this can pressure companies to act more responsibly. Governments and large companies often set the rules, but they are influenced by the choices and opinions of the people. If everyone waited for someone else to fix things, nothing would change. Therefore, each person has a responsibility to care for the environment, and together our actions can lead to real improvements too. In conclusion, it is not just up to governments and businesses; everyone can and should help protect our planet, starting with their own everyday choices."
1243,2,People living in large cities have to face many problems in everyday life. What are those problems?Should the government encourage people to move to regional towns?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is no doubt that cities are amongst the most convienient places for accommodation but with it, comes many sophisticated issuses, threatening the residents quality of life.In my opinion,in order to solve this problem,it is essential for governments balance the country's population distribution by encouring people to move to rural areas.
What are the difficulties while living in large cities then?Firstly, it is the lack of jobs and occupations due to the fierce competitiveness between thousands of applicants.Moreover,because of high number of employees,regularly will companies raise their standards making it painfully challenging to get a job .For instance,to be hired as an accountant,not only do you need flawless techinque skills but also flexibility and adaptiveness to satisfy the company's demand and surpass other applicants.Secondly,the increasing population density can be a potential security endangerment as the rate of criminals and lawbreakers is significantly higher than places with fewer residents.Furthermore,tracking down criminals will more challenging because of the widespread radius of populated areas.For example,chasing down a theif in a countryside would be far more easier than a city because there are less space to hide and shelter for the theifs.
Hence, the government should encourage people to move to outlying areas.At first glance,it fixes the issue of jobs and occupation as civilians are now fairly distributed to other regions, creating a less stressing and competitive working environment.As a matter of fact,the rate of poverty and famine will be reduced as the income for most famlies become higher thanks to more
job opportunities.In addition,by having scatterd citizen equally,we can ensure the safety of our people by managing the crime rate of each region.In fact,this will prevent crime concentration in one area but scatter them in many places,making it more convenient to protect civilians.
In conclusion,living in large cities can have multiple drawbacks,especially job opportunity and security therefore motivating citizen relocate to urban areas should be considered as soon as possible for the reasons above.",,,,,,7.0,"Large cities are often associated with better facilities and more modern lifestyles, but living in such bustling places brings about several daily challenges. One major problem is the severe traffic congestion caused by the dramatic increase in vehicles, leading to long commutes and wasted time for residents. This also results in heightened levels of air pollution, which can negatively impact people’s health, especially children and the elderly. Furthermore, the high cost of living in cities, including expensive housing, groceries, and basic services, creates financial pressure for many families. For example, in my own city, affordable apartments are rare, forcing people to live far from their workplaces or to share small spaces with others, which can be uncomfortable and stressful. Additionally, city life is often accompanied by noise pollution and a lack of green spaces, making it hard for individuals to relax and maintain mental well-being. Because of these issues, I believe the government should take active measures to encourage people to move to regional towns. By investing in infrastructure, healthcare, and education in those areas, authorities can make regional living more appealing. This not only helps decongest cities but also balances economic development and improves the quality of life for people who choose to live outside metropolitan centers."

From my personal experenice, where I am living in a fast pace city, people becomes more and more often to have emotional problems or even mental disease, because living in big cities are moving too fast with very high work load, expensive living cost, overpopulation, bad city planning(too much building with not enough green enviorment) etc. All that makes the cities people are living under stress and depress, not to mention, everyday there are more and more new comers moving into town and try to get a job in the cities. That makes the surviving games in the cities becoming harder to settle or I wouldn't imageine to win.
Yes, the government should encourage people to move to regional towns. From where I based, our govern are already encouraging people to move out the cities for years, they clearly knew the problem are getting on the surface. They have offered special plans and supports for cities peoples who willingly to move out and go to the undeveloped cities. But still, not more locals are buying the govern's plans, because moving out to undeveloped cities meaning staying away with friends and familes and cultivate virgin land takes a lot of hard work too.

Also, the price of food, transportation, and healthcare is much higher than what my friends pay who live in smaller towns, so sometimes it is hard to save any money. Because there are so many people everywhere, it is also not easy to find some quiet or green space to relax, and that can make people stressed or even lonely. In my opinion, the government should try to encourage people to move to regional towns, because it can help balance the population and reduce pressure on the big cities. For example, if the government builds more schools, hospitals, and entertainment in those areas, more families will want to live there. If more jobs are created outside of the cities, people won’t have to move to the city just to survive.

Although, regional towns are small and provide a simple lifestyle, I still think that large cities offer a better lifestyle and much better facilities.
It is true that regional towns have a simpler lifestyle and are not completely industrialized, which leads to a better environment and healthier people. Some people say that large cities have a few problems like traffic and high population. I, however, believe that the advantages of living in a big city, completely outweigh the disadvantages.
Firstly, Due the modernisation and globalisation of industries, various multinational companies look for employees and are usually situated in urban areas. People move from rural areas to urban towns to look for employment with higher salaries as well as international exposure. Secondly, cities have a vast network of transportation available which is more frequent and comfortable for the commuters. Many people from small towns transit through big cities for inter-state or international travels. Lastly, large towns provide better accommodation for people with better living facilities. They have huge buildings with many apartments which are very well structured. These buildings also have facilites like gym, pools, grocery shops e.t.c. so that residents don't have to travel far. Which is why, when people move from small towns, it is easier for them to rent a room according to their budget and requirements.

The most common problems involve overcrowding, which leads to heavy traffic congestion and long commuting times, making it stressful for people to travel to work or school.

The high cost of living is also a major concern in big cities; everything from housing to groceries tends to be more expensive, putting a strain on many families. While some suggest that the government should encourage people to move to regional towns, I believe this is only a partial solution. Regional towns often lack the job opportunities, healthcare, and educational facilities that are easily available in cities. For example, my cousin had to move back to the city after trying to settle in a smaller town because she could not find a suitable job and her children’s school options were too limited. Rather than simply moving people out of cities, governments should focus on improving infrastructure and services in both urban and regional areas, making it possible for people to choose where to live based on their needs and preferences rather than necessity. Thus, while city life comes with certain difficulties, a balanced and thoughtful approach toward development is essential, rather than encouraging a mass exodus to regional towns."

I believe there are two main types of issues people live in urban city face, and I agree with the opinion that goverment should encourage people to leave crowded area.
Firstly, people live in large city struggle with noisy sound. Currently, big city, especially capital, have a lot of people and transportation system. These sometimes sounds noisy. It disturb people forcusing on something, sleeping in better condition. I remenber that these noisy sound sometimes prevented me from studying in my house when I was high school student. This experience clearly express how much noisy sound disturb people's comfortable life.
Another main issue that big city resident face is crowded train. Since there are many people who commute, people have to ride on crowded train, which is uncomfortable for users. Moreover, crowed train is more risky for users facing incidents compare to ordinary one.
This is also serious hardship for population living in large city.
To solve these matters, goverment should recommend people to live in regional areas.

Another main issue that big city resident face is crowded train. Since there are many people who commute, people have to ride on crowded train, which is uncomfortable for users. Moreover, crowed train is more risky for users facing incidents compare to ordinary one.
This is also serious hardship for population living in large city.
To solve these matters, goverment should recommend people to live in regional areas. It would not only makes people release from issues that I showed above, and also it may get rid of risks that incident occur. In fact, a statistics show that people who live in rural area feel happy compared to people who live in large city.
In conclusion, population who live in city face many issues like noisy sound and crowded train. And if authorities encouraged people to move to rural regions, people would feel spend more comfortable life, as they release from some uncomfortable that they feel in large city.",,,,,,6.0,"Living in big cities brings many difficult problems for people. The most common challenges are expensive cost of living, traffic congestion, and lack of green spaces. For instance, in my own city, rent and food cost much more than in small towns, making it difficult for students and young workers. Also, traffic is always crowded during the morning and evening, causing stress and making people waste a lot of time every day. Besides, people do not have enough parks or nature to relax, which can cause health problems. I believe the government should suggest that people move to smaller regional towns. If more people know the benefits of living in quieter places, such as cheaper housing and less pollution, they may consider moving. For example, my cousin moved to a smaller town last year, and she is much happier than before. Overall, city residents face a lot of problems, and encouraging people to move to regional towns can help improve their quality of life and reduce the pressure on big cities."

What are those problems?Should the government encourage people to move to regional towns?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is not surprise to see that major cities are struggling with various issues which may associate with goverment and public issues as well.These issues are mild in some cities where as severe and vulnerable in few cities.
Some of the common problems are increased crime rate,reduced safety,air pollution,noise pollution,flood,mechanical life and reduced greenery.
The main cause for the above issues are increased population,uncontrolled carbon emission,poorly planned road and other public facilities such as underground drainage,contaminated water,roads and electricity.
In general if the government take steps to control the above mentioned issues by implenting good law and orders which can improve public safety and happiness.Assist the sanitary boards with proper funding which may help to reduce water stagnant during rainy season.Funding for new research and developments may enhance to clear air and water pollution which can bring good health to the local residents.
In contrast government may consider to develop the nearest towns with basic facilities such as modern housing,
educational advancements,good roads,water and sanitary facilities. These facilities enhance the people to move to smaller town which may enhance to manage the key issues which are currently facing in the major cities.
For instance Delhi,Capital of India seriously struggling with severe air pollution and lack of security which is heavily populated.Researches says that these problems can be reduced if the population rate is reduced.
Meantime some group of people suggests that if the government may adopt new technology or structure which are following by any successful cities in the world.I personally feels that this also could be a better solution if it can be adopted by the government.

Some of the main problems include overcrowding, which leads to traffic jams, longer commute times, and a lack of personal space. Air and noise pollution are also serious issues, as so many vehicles and factories can affect people's health. Furthermore, housing in big cities is often expensive and limited, making it difficult for many families to find comfortable and affordable places to live. Another problem is the high cost of living, including food, transportation, and medical care, which can put a lot of pressure on residents. Because of these problems, I believe the government should encourage people to move to regional towns. The government can do this by improving infrastructure in those towns, such as schools, hospitals, and job opportunities, making them more attractive places to live. For example, in some countries like Australia, the government offers incentives for people to settle in regional areas in order to reduce pressure on big cities like Sydney and Melbourne. Moving some of the population to smaller towns could help solve overcrowding and pollution in the cities while also creating new opportunities in regional areas. Overall, encouraging people to move to regional towns could lead to a more balanced and healthier environment for everyone."
1255,2,More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The problem of understainding whether there is an age that could be consider perfect to have a child is very debated. It is nowadays very common to have children over 40 years old. After explaining the reasons besides this tendency (a different life-style and conception of education and the role that women play in our society), I will argue in favour of this tendency by explaining that the disadvantages can be outweighed.
The reasons why today people have children in their later age are due to two factors. Firstly, there is a new conception of education and people when finish their studies sometimes have to wait years before finding a good paid position. On the other hand, new technologies and new medical treatments have made people around 60 looking in the same way as my grandmother was in her 40. The central cause of this tendency is surely linked with the role that women play in our society. They study and work and they have to find a good job position in the same way as their male counterparts have to do. This involve that a woman cannot take the time that she need to grow up a child when she is 25 (at that age she is usually in Academia yet). Rather, she will think about the possibility of having a child after started her career. Then, there are positive effects produced by this new tendency. Children are loved and considered by their parents as miracles. On the other hand, they can grow up in a family in which his parents have good jobs. Neither the mother or the father have to sacrifice a part of their life because they had a child too young.
My mum got me when she was over 40. Twenty-three years ago this was consider an exception. Although I confronted my-self with the possible disadvantages that could be produced by having child late, I cannot present them as real issues. People believe that a not-young parent cannot understand your needs and your thoughts. However, this is false. Indeed, If a person is open-minded, she will always is, whatever the age. The only possible disadvantage concerns the fear of losing your parents soon. While people start to think about the possible death of their parents when they are around 30 years old, I started to think about that when I was 20. But it is just fear. Therefore, I believe that there are not concrete reasons to be against this tendency. If we start to conceive the idea of having a baby as an immense gift, we will reasonably have to understand that we have to be prepared to grow up the child and to dedicate to him all the time he needs. Then, it is amazing if this is possible to have all of this when a woman is 25. But, if the family (father and mother together) wants to start their career first, they cannot be judged. There is not a perfect moment to have a child. Sometimes to wait involve do better.
In conclusion, I believe that there are not disadvantages to be outweighted. The two possible disadvantages I presented are not worst than those people having children at their young age have to deal with.",,,,,,6.0,"In recent years, it has become increasingly common for people to choose to have children at a later age compared to previous generations. One major reason for this shift is the growing importance of higher education and establishing a secure career before starting a family. Nowadays, many individuals, especially women, spend more years in university and then dedicate additional time to building their professional life, making early parenthood less feasible. Furthermore, modern medicine and improved health standards mean that individuals can safely conceive and raise children later in life. This pattern is particularly shaped by changing societal norms regarding gender roles, as women are now encouraged to follow their ambitions in the workplace just as men do. Although some argue that older parents might struggle with energy levels or worry about being absent during their child’s adulthood, the advantages generally outweigh such disadvantages. More mature parents are often more financially stable, experienced, and emotionally prepared to care for children responsibly. For instance, my cousin decided to have a baby in her late thirties, after progressing in her career, and she has expressed how her life experience allows her to make wiser parenting decisions. While concerns about age-related health risks do exist, advances in healthcare largely mitigate them, and the benefits — such as greater economic security, emotional readiness, and life satisfaction — make delayed parenthood a positive trend overall."

The main reason why that happened is the high life expenses, whereas that eventually will affects the health status of both the mother and fetus, it is eventhough sometimes carried out some diseases. This essay will discuss why it is dangerous and give you some evidences.
Increasing the costs of daily necessary items for example, these days if you go to the grocery shop and just buy the simply needs vegetables or fruits you will end up with a very significant amount of money payment. Consequently, with that the majority of population tend to become a finically stable before getting a kid.
Unfortunately, giving birth to a baby in fourteen is critical and there is a lot of sequences following that. In order that It is required more attention and care for that topic we should develop a program to teach the parents with no exception because some of mothers seems they are unlikely to have awareness of the difficulties.
Provided that there was a case I remember just passes to my mind of a pregnant women cames to the emergency room in a disaster situation then turn on that if she gives birth, there could be possibility of one of them will die (her or the baby), simply because she was very old in her fourteen.
In summary, some people restricted to finical part and forgetting a more important one which is the safety of the women as well as the fetus.",,,,,,4.5,"In recent years, many couples are choosing to have children at an older age, which is somewhat different from the past when starting a family early was more normal. The big reason for this change is that individuals want to finish their education, focus on building a stable career, and save enough money to give their kids a good life before having them. This makes sense because life has become much more expensive and competitive, so people feel pressured to be prepared. However, there are some problems with having children later, such as more health risks for both the mother and baby, like difficulties during pregnancy or chances of genetic issues. Despite these disadvantages, I think the advantages of waiting are stronger because parents can provide a better home and are probably more mature and ready for the responsibility of raising a child. For example, one of my relatives had her baby after turning thirty-five, and even though she needed extra medical care, she was able to take good care of her child since she had a solid job and supportive partner. In conclusion, while waiting to have kids does bring some health concerns, the benefits of being better prepared in life generally lead to improved outcomes for both parents and children."

Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Over the past decades, it has been registered a considerable decrease in the percentage of people eager to create a family at a young age. There could be different reasons for this and I am going to state them clearly in the following paragraphs, which will also explain why I believe the advantages of this situation far outweigh the disadvantages.
Apparently, the society we currently live in has undergone substantial changes over the years, sometimes without us even noticing it. The most evident of these variations has probably been the gradual rise in the number of old people as opposed to the dramatic fall in the number of births. In fact, owing to the decline of the economy of most nations and the subsequent reduction of work opportunities, more and more people are giving up on the idea of becoming parents in their 20s or 30s. Many people see this as a negative aspect for our society; however, I have to strongly disagree with their opinion.
The drawbacks to which a lot of people point out when discussing about these kind of topics often has to do with the age gap between parents and their children. Admittedly, someone cannot decide to have a child in their 40s without considering the significant generation gap that would separate them from their kids and, as a result, the issues of miscommunication that could arise.
However, the disadvantages become of secondary importance as soon as the much more remarkable benefits are examined. First of all, older parents also means more responsible and mature caretakers; consequently, due to their broader life experience, they would arguably make better advisors for their kids. Not to mention that older parents would not only have more stable and secure jobs, but they would also have more consistent savings to devote to their children's further education, which in turn could help the latter having a better and well-paid job in the future.
To conclude, although it's impossible not to take into account the drawbacks of having a child at a more advanced age, the advantages still outrun the disadvantages. Thus, children would be the first to benefit from such a situation.",,,,,,8.5,"In recent years, it has become increasingly common for people to postpone parenthood, with many individuals choosing to have children later in life compared to previous generations. One of the primary reasons for this shift is the growing emphasis on education and career advancement. Nowadays, both men and women often wish to establish themselves professionally and achieve financial stability before starting a family, considering these factors crucial for providing a better life for their children. Furthermore, advancements in healthcare and fertility treatments have made it more feasible for individuals to become parents at an older age, reducing some of the biological concerns that previously encouraged earlier pregnancies. On the one hand, delayed parenthood can result in a greater generational gap and potential health risks for both mothers and their babies; for example, older parents might struggle more with the physical demands of raising young children. However, these drawbacks seem relatively minor compared to the advantages. Older parents are typically more mature and emotionally prepared, and their life experiences often translate into improved parenting skills and decision-making. Moreover, their financial security can provide children with access to quality education and extracurricular opportunities that might not be possible for younger, less established parents. Therefore, despite some disadvantages, I strongly believe the benefits of having children later in life far surpass the drawbacks, ultimately creating a more nurturing and supportive environment for the next generation."
1261,2,More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"It is true that today, people tend to give birth when they are older than their previous generation. This trend has several negative and positive effects on their daily life.
On the one hand, there are several disadvantages for those who want to have children in their later age. First, moms could suffer from many serious health problems when they give birth late. Those who are older than 35 of age has the higher rate of death because their hormone levels are not suitable for giving birth which lead to medical accidents. Second, boys or girls whose their mother is older than 35 also tend to suffer from many problems. For example, it is easier to have pneumonia for children from those mothers because the preterm birth rate of this group of mothers is higher.
On the other hand, I am on the side with those who believe that there are more benefits to having children when they are older. Firstly, people could prepare a better foundation for their children. Raising a boy or a girl is a job which needs both much effort, money and time. Therefore, many people decide to work hard and earn much money they can because it could build a more solid infrastructure for their children. Secondly, it is important for children to have both their parents during their process of growing up. The rate of crime in terms of teenagers, who grow up without mother or father, is higher than those who live with parents. Thus, the decisions such as having marriage or giving birth are crucial when the younger tend to decide quickly.

Additionally, societal attitudes have shifted, allowing people to feel less pressure to marry and have children at a young age. Although giving birth later can present certain disadvantages, such as increased health risks for both mothers and infants, there are notable advantages as well. Older parents often possess greater life experience and emotional maturity, equipping them to provide better guidance and support for their children. Furthermore, waiting to have children often means parents are in a stronger economic position, which can lead to improved opportunities for their offspring. While there are health concerns to consider, I believe the advantages of financial security, preparedness, and emotional stability typically outweigh the drawbacks, as they help create a more nurturing environment for children to grow up in."
1263,2,"In recent years, the family structure has changed, as well as family roles. What are the changes occurring? Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","At present, it is possible to note that families come in different and diverse structures. Overall, these changes occur because of women are entering the work force, which changes the roles of a traditional family. I strongly believe that these changes are positive to society and to the economy. In the following paragraphs I will present my reasons to have such opinion.
One major factor that affects family structures is women being allowed to work outside their homes. Within the last century, women joined the work force, modifying the traditional family setting that was compoused by men being the ones who provided for their families. Therefore, the roles changed as both mothers and fathers could financially provide for their children. Moreover, women do not need to rely on their husbands to raise children as they have jobs themselves, and they might even decide to raise a baby by their own, creating a new type of family strucutre that is comprised of only a mother and a child. Furthermore, couples can even decide not to have children at all, and only focus on their carreers, as women have the possibility of being a lot more than mothers.
These changes are definitly positive of an economical and societal point of view. Women are now part of the work force, therefore, they contribute for the economy. Besides that, changes in family structures and roles make people more tolerant, as they see that there is no limitation for what a women can do.
To summarize, there are indeed several changes occurring in families structures, and the roles people play in it. Women being part of the work force has changed male and female contribution to a family, which has a positive impact, socially and economically speaking.",,,,,,6.0,"Nowadays, the structure and roles within families look very different than they did in the past. Families are no longer only made up of two parents and their children; many people now grow up in single-parent homes, with step-parents, or even with grandparents playing the main caregiving role. One important reason for this is that more women are no longer expected to stay home but are able to work and build their own careers just like men. As a result, both mothers and fathers take on responsibilities like earning money and looking after the household. Additionally, it is becoming more common for people to choose not to have children at all or to wait until later in life to start a family. From my perspective, these changes are mostly positive, because they provide both men and women with more freedom in making decisions about their lives and careers. For example, in my own family, my mother works full-time and my father shares cooking and cleaning duties so they both have time for work and family. With these new family models, children grow up seeing that anyone, regardless of gender, can pursue their goals, and that families can be supportive in many different forms. In summary, although the traditional family has changed, I believe these shifts lead to a more flexible and equal society."
1265,2,"In recent years, the family structure has changed, as well as family roles. What are the changes occurring? Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In our modern days, families had witnessed a considerable change regarding their structure and the roles of individuals inside it. These changes are mainly the patriarchal structure that was dominating families in the past compared to a more balanced arrangement nowadays. In addition to that, there are more freedom and rights for women in recent years. And I believe its an advantageous development.
Fathers used to be the only leaders of the families of past decades, however in recent days mothers had shared the leadership and started taking part in family decisions just like their partners. Also during recent decades women obtained greater deal of their civil rights which allowed them to take different roles from those that were common for females in the past decades. As an example, women can now own the family house, sign important documents, drive cars which were a breakthrough for women to be able to participate in family plannings and decisions.
It appears to be an advantage to have women being able to be effective members of their families, that is because they can share responsibility, add their feminine qualities to the lives of their families as well as for them to be able to fulfill their own life by feeling the importance of their existence and their roles.
As in a recent research that found families with women in them are happier, more content, and definitely healthier.
In conclusion, the family system nowadays differs vastly from before, owing to the more roles that women are taking, and to the more rights and freedom they gained, and in my perspective it is a positive change.",,,,,,6.5,"In today’s society, there have been noticeable shifts in how families are structured and how roles within the household are distributed. Unlike in the past, when most families were extended and usually led by a father figure, modern families are becoming smaller, often nuclear, and both parents typically share in the responsibilities of decision-making and earning an income. For instance, it is now commonplace for mothers to have full-time jobs and for fathers to participate in household chores and child-rearing, blurring the old boundaries that once separated men’s and women’s work. I think these changes are mostly positive because they promote equality between men and women and help each family member pursue their own interests and develop as individuals. Additionally, children who grow up in these more balanced family structures may learn to value fairness and cooperation, which can benefit society as a whole. From my experience, having both parents actively engaged at home leads to stronger relationships among family members and allows for a more adaptable and supportive family unit. In conclusion, the evolving family roles and structures reflect progress toward greater gender equality and personal freedom, which I believe is a highly beneficial development."
1267,2,"In recent years, the family structure has changed, as well as family roles. What are the changes occurring? Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","As the '70s of the last century started, the world lived a social revolution that led to a change in the family structure and in family roles' conception.
I believe these changes are positive and take people to be more inclusive towards all forms of love: heterosexual and homosexual. The social revolution permitted also women to impose their role in the workplace as leaders and not just in the house as mothers.
In the last decades a revolution concerning the concept of family led to conceive the couple and not just the married heterosexual couple with at least a child as complete and valued families. This social step is crucial since before that people who loved a person of the same sex as well as women who decided to have no child were treated by society as the maker of the family collapse. In Sicily, for instance, where there is still a lot of work to be done in this respect, it was almost crazy to define a group of people composed of a woman and a man with a son born outside marriage to fall under the concept of family. Therefore, I believe that this social change is taking people to believe step by step that all forms of love must be respected and most crucially they are starting to understand the concept of family as the non-physical place in which love lives.
The role of women in the workplace and in the house radically changed in the same years. The revolution concerned both the conception of women as free independent workers who obtain leadership positions as well as the conception of women as wifes and mothers. Indeed, women are no anymore required to live their life trying to make the house perfectly clean, satisfy the husband's desires and grow up the children. At the same time, husbands discover again their role as fathers and not just as money-maker of the house. Thus thanks to social change women can dedicate time to themself to their passions and give importance not just to their role as mothers but also to their role in the workplace as leaders.
In conclusion, I believe the social change that characterised the last decades produced positive changes that permitted us to obtain a new understanding of the conception of family and love and to evaluate the role of women in the house and outside as free and independent workers.",,,,,,6.5,"In recent decades, the traditional family structure has undergone significant transformations, altering both the makeup of families and the roles individuals play within them. It is increasingly common to find single-parent households, blended families, and families led by same-sex couples, rather than the previously dominant model of a married heterosexual couple with children. Furthermore, traditional gender roles have shifted; women are more likely to have careers and share breadwinning responsibilities, while men are more involved in parenting and domestic duties. I view these developments as overwhelmingly positive because they promote equality, allow people to pursue their own interests and strengths, and recognize the diversity of human relationships. For example, in my local area, I have observed that children who grow up in homes where parents share both household tasks and emotional support tend to have healthier attitudes toward gender equality. Although some fear these changes undermine social stability, I believe they create a more just and adaptable society where all people have the opportunity to thrive within their families. In conclusion, the evolution of family structures and roles leads to greater acceptance, equality, and the freedom for individuals to define what “family” means to them."

Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Recently, there have been significant changes in the family structure and family roles. This essay will illuminate some of these changes and analyse whether such changes are beneficial or detrimental.
One of the most prominent changes in this regard refers to the tendency of couples having fewer children or even no children, which may be attributed to adults' increasing workload and ensuing inability to look after children properly. Given their hectic schedules and rational concerns about their limited time and patience in taking care of adolescents, many couples would rather have fewer children. Another change is the growing trend of females joining the workforce, as necessitated by increasing living expenses, such as utility bills and property prices. To afford such costs and reach expected living standards, females have to give up being family women and apply for jobs. The other factor driving women to take jobs is the popularity of feminism upholding that women should be equal to men in all aspects, including employment.
As far as I am concerned, these changes derive from people's practical and merticulous considerations in the face of huge challenges, namely, the lack of time to take care of minors and soaring living costs. To tackles these obstacles, it is necessary for people to make such changes. Therefore, I vehemently support these changes.
To sum up, the modern society is witnessing great changes in the family structure and family roles, as exemplified by the smaller family size and larger number of females taking jobs. Personally, I think these are positive changes.",,,,,,8.5,"In recent years, noticeable transformations have occurred in both family structure and the division of responsibilities among family members. Traditionally, families were comprised of multiple generations living under one roof, with clear roles: men as the primary breadwinners and women as homemakers. However, the modern family has shifted towards nuclear units with fewer children, primarily due to urbanization and changes in lifestyle priorities. Additionally, a significant change is the increasing participation of women in the workforce, motivated not only by economic demands but also by the desire for personal and professional fulfillment. Furthermore, fathers are becoming more involved in household chores and childcare, thereby balancing duties that were once the sole domain of women. In my view, these changes are largely positive. They encourage gender equality, independence, and a more equitable distribution of domestic responsibilities. Moreover, when both parents contribute financially and share child-rearing duties, it can lead to stronger family bonds and improved well-being for all members. From my own observation, children gain broader perspectives and become more adaptable when exposed to diverse family roles. In conclusion, contemporary changes in family structure and roles reflect a progressive society, fostering fairness and opportunities for personal growth."

It is my opinion that history is a precious source of information that we inherent from the older generations and history is important for our future. This essay will discuss both views and give reasons to support my points.
Some people think that the history is not important for us to grow and develop in our current life. I personally think that this is not true because our development in society today is the outcomes of learning from our mistakes in history. In addition, the history of our country or our region will help to enhance knowledge about our culture, beliefs or religions. These values are generational heritages and it is impossible for the new generation to obtain the cultural values without learning about history.
It is widely agreed that history is a valuable source of knowledge that enables human development and prosperity. The records of events and experiences of the older generations will be helpful for us in building our society for future generations. For example, in order to build the current social welfare system in America, the government has to look at the failures of other countries in the history and considers which approaches will be appropriate for their people. In addition, learning about history can broaden our understandings about human philosophy, human interations and conflicts. These knowledge are significantly important for our development intellectually and spiritually.
In summary, we can learn a lot from history and history is important for human development.",,,,,,7.0,"There are different views regarding whether we can learn anything valuable from the past in order to improve our lives today. Some believe that studying history has little to offer, arguing that the world has changed so much that old experiences and lessons cannot apply to modern challenges. They claim that advancements in technology, new social systems, and unique present-day problems make history less relevant for solving current issues. However, I believe that history remains an essential source of knowledge for understanding human life and shaping our future. By examining historical events and patterns, societies can learn from previous mistakes and achievements, which helps us make more informed decisions. For instance, in times of economic crisis, leaders often look at how similar issues were handled in the past to find effective solutions. Furthermore, appreciating our cultural and national history strengthens our sense of identity and community, contributing to social unity. Without the lessons provided by history, we risk repeating errors and losing important values. In conclusion, although some may doubt its importance, I am convinced that history provides us with meaningful guidance for both our personal lives and collective progress."

Although there are some strong arguments against learning history, I agree with learning history to know life of human.
There are two reasons why people think there is nothing to gain from history. Firstly, there is evidence to support the idea that learning history stresses people out. Based on a survey conducted by Standford University, 57 percent of people consider learning past life of humans a primary source of stress, while less than 6 percent of people said studying previous humans' life was not a stressor. Secondly, people may not have time to remember historical events because the constant stimulation and hustle and bustle of society is holding them back from their life. In turn, they are more likely to regard learning history as useless.
Despite the negative drawbacks, I support that historical event is great information to comprehend human's life. The main benefit of a historical event is that it can have a positive impact on people, especially children, as they grow up. Since history has more connection and support to our lives, it allows children to become more insightful and knowledgeable and discover advanced perspectives. For example, I have been widening my perspective through historical events in my family or country because gaining history regarding my family and nation taught me the right attitude to understand today. However, if I did not know any history, I would not have had an opportunity to understand human life and self-development. So, learning history should be encouraged.
In conclusion, while I recognize the possible disadvantages of learning history, I believe that the benefits of gaining past events far outweigh them in the long term.",,,,,,6.5,"Some people argue that there is nothing valuable to learn from the past, while others strongly believe history is essential for understanding human life. There are some reasons why people may feel history is not helpful today. One reason is that rapid changes in technology and society make old events seem irrelevant to current problems. For instance, many students find it difficult to relate ancient wars or traditions to their daily experiences, thinking these facts have no impact on modern life. Also, some individuals claim that focusing too much on the past can prevent people from adapting to the future, as they may become stuck on outdated ideas. However, I believe there are significant advantages to learning from history. History gives us lessons about human behavior, mistakes, and achievements, which can guide us in making better decisions. For example, by studying the causes of major conflicts or the achievements of leaders, we can learn how to avoid repeating errors and inspire positive change in our own communities.

According to the former there is nothing we can learn for our history. Instead, the latter sustains that the past a vital source for the understaing of our present life. I believe that in virtue of the action made in the history we must learn what is better and what is dangerous for human's life. History is then our method to evaluate whether the choices we make at the present time are right or wrong.
I believe that history can teach us more than we can imagine. The past teached us how much pain humans being tolerate because of the wars. To understand the reasons and the causes of the conflicts between the countries it is the best way to proceed through a more pacific and civil relationship among the States. To make the idea clearer I want to propose the following analogy as example: as the awarness of our past actions (in other words, the actions we have done when we were children) taught that the fire burns and that we should pay attention when we get closer to it, we then can understand how much pain a war can take with it by reflecting on the pains that aflicted our ancestors because of the Second World War.
On the other hand, there are people supporting the thesis according to which history cannot teach anything to us. They start from the idea that our life today is completely different, techonological and then very far from what our ancestors lived. The world in which we live seems to them as another world with respect to that in which their grandparents lived. Hence, history results to be as a novel that cannot be used to make easier the human's progress. Thus the errors made by our grandfathers cannot be analysed with the contemporary eyes, they maybe could not be understood totally. Then the past's mistakes are not an alarm to remind us what we did and what we should try to escape from. Rather, they are nothing, just memories. According to this way of thinking, the world seems to be divided in temporal blocks each of which has no links with the others. History is reduced to an intricate novel.
In conclusion, I believe that history should be conceived as the first evaluation step of our present actions. By grasping the power that should come from a real understaing of our past, it is possible to analyse critically the present world order.",,,,,,6.0,"There are differing opinions about whether history is relevant to our current lives, with some arguing that it has nothing to teach us, while others see it as an important source of knowledge. Those who dismiss the value of history often point to the rapid changes in technology and society, claiming that the world we live in today is unique and distant from anything experienced before, so lessons from the past are outdated or irrelevant. They argue that the problems we face now require new ideas and innovative solutions, not old wisdom. On the other hand, many people believe that understanding history helps us avoid repeating past errors and enables us to manage the present more wisely. For instance, learning about the causes of past financial crises can guide governments to create more stable economies today, or studying old epidemics informs how to handle modern health emergencies. In my view, history is essential because it provides context for our present decisions and reminds us of both the successes and failures that shaped the world we live in. Ignoring history makes it more likely that we will make the same mistakes, whereas learning from it can lead to better choices in the future."

On the other hand, others insist that history is a rich guidebook full of lessons, mistakes, and wisdom that can prevent us from making similar errors. From my perspective, I strongly believe that learning from the past is essential. The past is not just a collection of old stories; it is filled with examples of human behavior and the consequences of certain actions. If we study events like past wars, economic crises, or even great achievements, we can better understand patterns and avoid making the same mistakes. For example, by examining financial crashes in the previous century, modern investors and policy makers have built systems to safeguard against repeating those errors. In conclusion, while some doubt history’s relevance, I think it offers crucial guidance for both individuals and societies, helping us to build a better future from the lessons we have inherited."

Supporters of the first viewpoint argue that the challenges we face now are so different from those faced by our ancestors that lessons from their times are not applicable. For example, advances in technology and shifts in cultural norms have created situations that previous generations could not have imagined, so relying on their experiences may lead to outdated solutions. In contrast, those who value history view it as a treasure trove of wisdom, offering countless lessons on the consequences of certain actions, both positive and negative. They believe that by studying events such as wars, revolutions, and social changes, we can avoid repeating mistakes and make more informed decisions about the future. Personally, I believe that the past holds significant value for us, as it provides context for present circumstances and helps us recognize patterns in human behavior. Learning about historical figures who overcame adversity, or societies that thrived through cooperation, can inspire us to face our own challenges more thoughtfully. Therefore, while not every detail from history may be directly relevant, overall, a strong grasp of the past enriches our understanding and better prepares us for the future."

Regrettably . many people suffer form disadvantages situtaions nowdays like losing jobs or money ,they find themselves have no energy or motive to contiune and to help their families .

Having extra money or resources allows people to make a real impact in the lives of those who are struggling. For example, a rich person could sponsor the education of underprivileged children or provide funds to build hospitals or schools where they are most needed. These actions have long-term positive effects on society and can break the cycle of poverty for many families. Furthermore, charitable work often brings personal satisfaction to the giver, as it allows them to contribute to something bigger than themselves. Although some people argue that being rich is more important for personal comfort or status, I believe those benefits are less meaningful without giving back to others. In conclusion, I think the true value of wealth lies in using it to assist people who are less fortunate, since this not only improves society but also fosters a sense of humanity and unity."

There are certain aspect about being wealthy in which it could give oppurtunity to others and aid them through their toughest times.
According to my point of view, being wealthy could be very beneficial to others who may not achieve the same oppurtunity as the ones with all the wealth. But according to my knowledge about this argument, being rich gives other individuals the oppurtunity to help. I do believe it is crucial for a rich person to help others since it gives a positive impact to them. There could be negative influences to a rich person associated with others but for the majority, its very beneficial.
Since I have grown up in a city where poverty and the wealthy people were mixed together. Throughout my upbringing, I have been involved with peers who were financially stable yet some were not so fortunate. All throughout my childhood and adulthood I was gracefully apart of the middle class where we were financially stable and were able to end the month without a struggle. I consider myself as someone with a big heart where if one of my mates were unable to afford a specific food or snack, out of kindness and care I would propose to pay for it.
The government in the city that I have spent my life in plays a major role into financially helping the citizens who are not financially stable. The government would donate large amounts of money and gift the major population money according to their stability. The government would gift money to people who have been a part of the society wether it was having a specific job or helping clean up the city when it went through a hurricane or other crisis. As far as I am concerned, the government in my city is extremely wealthy with large amounts of money to spare for its people. Of course there are certain limits on the amount the government gifts but for the majority of the time they have little to no struggle when helping other people.",,,,,,7.0,"In my opinion, one of the greatest advantages of being wealthy is the potential it provides for helping others who are less fortunate. I believe when people have more money, it is their responsibility to use some of their wealth to make a difference in other people’s lives. Helping others not only improves the community, but it also gives the wealthy person a sense of purpose and satisfaction. For example, in my neighborhood, there is a businessman who pays for underprivileged children to go to school, and thanks to his help, many kids now have the chance for a brighter future. I have also seen famous celebrities and athletes use their riches to start charities and donate to causes like health care and education. While having lots of money can lead to a luxurious lifestyle, I believe the most important part of being rich is having the ability to share good fortune and give hope to those who need it. In the end, I agree that the real value of wealth comes from the opportunities it creates to help and support others."
1284,2,"There is a moral necessity today for the richer countries of the world to help the poorer countries develop in terms of feeding the population, education and health care. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","The world today is often divided into two categories, more developed and less developed countries. This division is significant in terms of health, wealth and education. To minimise this gap, it is argued that richer countries are morally responsible to support the less wealthy. I, personally, feel that the prosperous countries are obligated and expected to to contribute to the development of countries with weaker economies.To address this argument, the history of the wealthy countries is relevant. Many less developed countries are former colonies, therefore the wealthy countries had a historical impact on the less wealthy. Thus, richer countries’ economies were dependent on the currently less developed countries for their rich status. Furthermore, even today the wealthy countries contribute to the wealth inequality by exploiting the inhabitants of less developed countries, giving workers lower wages than people within their own countries. Due to this dependence on poorer countries and the influence that the richer countries have had on the imbalance, it can be concluded that richer countries are indeed morally obliged to help the less wealthy countries.Opposing this is the view that each country is in charge of their own inhabitants and that therefore they need to provide health, education and basic necessities for themselves. In addition, simply providing these three services would not lead to closing the wealth gap. It would rather be helpful to invest sustainably in poorer countries and help them create their own systems, allowing these countries to be self-sufficient.In conclusion, while there is a moral necessity for wealthy countries to aid the poorer ones, simply providing basic necessities is not sufficient. A more sustainable idea would be to teach countries to plan and provide for themselves by giving economic incentives.",,,,,,9.0,"In today’s global society, the disparity between affluent and impoverished nations has become more evident, particularly with regard to essentials such as food, education, and health care. I strongly agree that wealthier countries have a moral obligation to assist poorer nations in developing these fundamental sectors. First, much of the economic prosperity experienced by rich countries has, at times, been achieved at the expense of poorer regions, whether through the exploitation of resources or past colonial activities, which have left lasting impacts on development. In this sense, wealthier countries bear a level of responsibility to support those still affected by these historical inequalities. Moreover, assisting poorer nations is not just a moral issue but a practical one as well; global problems such as disease outbreaks, poverty-driven migration, and environmental degradation can have serious repercussions for both rich and poor countries alike. Providing support in education, healthcare, and food security helps foster stability that benefits everyone. On the other hand, critics might argue that every nation should independently support its citizens; however, the reality is that persistent poverty and lack of infrastructure often make this impossible without external aid. Recent examples, such as international vaccine distribution and educational funding, have shown that wealthier nations can make a significant difference by sharing resources and expertise in a respectful and cooperative manner. Therefore, while charity alone is not enough, a partnership approach between rich and poor countries is essential for building a fairer world. In conclusion, I believe there is both a practical and ethical necessity for richer countries to play a proactive role in helping develop the basic needs of poorer nations, making the world more equitable for all."
1285,2,"Some people like to own the place where they live, but other people like to rent where they live. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","The debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is one that has strong supporters on each side. There are persuasive arguments for both points of view.One of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility. Usually, a tenant only has to give a month’s notice before changing where he or she lives. If a property is owned and a change is needed, the property must be put onto the market and it is frequently a long and stressful process to get a sale completed. Sometimes, the wrong time of year or a bad market can mean that a sale is not possible. Another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a family’s capital is not tied up in the property. Property can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often a lot more. If one rents, this money can be spent on other things to help improve the family’s quality of life. If the property is on a mortgage, then the deposit, also often very large, is tied up in the property and the pressure of having to make substantial payments every month can cause a lot of stress.Owning a property does have various advantages, though. Even though people usually have to service a mortgage every month with payments, this money is then built up with the property. With renting, the money is lost to the landlord, but at the end of the term of the mortgage, the whole property is owned by the family. This makes the process of living in a property a type of investment. In addition, the property’s value often goes up after time, frequently creating a substantial profit. Owning the property where one lives can also create a sense of well-being and self-actualisation.The decision to whether one rents or owns the property in which one lives really boils down to individual preference. My opinion is that it is much more preferable to own a property, mainly because it creates a valuable asset for the family.",,,,,,9.0,"When it comes to the decision between owning and renting a home, both options present their own sets of benefits and challenges, and the best choice often depends on personal needs and circumstances. Supporters of renting often highlight the flexibility that comes with not being tied to a single property. Renters can more easily move for work opportunities or lifestyle changes, and they are not responsible for major repairs or maintenance costs, which can often lead to less stress and fewer unexpected expenses. Additionally, renting requires less upfront capital, which allows individuals to direct their savings towards travel, hobbies, or investments. However, many people argue that owning a home is preferable because it provides long-term stability and allows one to build equity over time. With each mortgage payment, a homeowner is essentially investing in their own future, and once the mortgage is paid off, housing costs may decrease significantly. Homeowners also have the freedom to modify their living spaces as they wish, making a house truly feel like a home. That being said, purchasing a property comes with significant responsibilities, such as property taxes and the risk of fluctuating real estate markets. In the end, I believe that owning a home is a better long-term investment, as it not only offers the potential for financial growth but also gives a sense of security and belonging. However, the decision should be based on one’s financial situation and lifestyle needs, as the advantages of renting cannot be ignored for those who value mobility and lower initial costs."
1286,2,People today find their lives more and more dominated by their jobs. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"It is certainly true that many people around the world find their lives dominated by the work that they have to do. This is shown when you realise how people’s work, and how much time, effort and resources they devote to it, is often the subject of conversation.Most people depend on their jobs to generate an income to pay for their lives’ necessities and luxuries, and so work can naturally become a dominating focus. As this is an important part of nearly everyone’s everyday life, it can seem that people’s lives are indeed becoming more influenced by their jobs. Whether this emphasis on work is more significant now than in previous years is debatable. In many developed countries around the world, there are procedures in place to help people with finding work, providing unemployment benefits, ensuring education, and offering pension payments. In times past, these provisions were not in place and a job or business was required to provide the necessary income.Therefore, in spite of increases in the cost of living in many places around the world, it can be argued there is actually less pressure than in previous years to keep one’s job and perform well at it. This, in turn, would lead to people’s lives being less influenced by their jobs today. It is also true that in the past, people were as responsible and focused on doing well in their responsibilities as today and so, in this respect, the people of the past would be equally dedicated to their work as people are today.While I agree that people’s lives today are often dominated by their jobs, I feel that the current situation is not necessarily worse than before. In fact, it may be more positive, due to the fewer pressures to earn money in many countries.",,,,,,9.0,"There is no doubt that work is a central part of most adults' lives, but whether it completely dominates people’s existence today is a matter of debate. Many individuals certainly spend a large proportion of their waking hours on job-related tasks, and with the advance of technology such as smartphones and email, work can often intrude into personal time, even during evenings and weekends. For example, many of my acquaintances regularly check their work messages and complete extra tasks after hours. However, it could be argued that this dominance is balanced by greater awareness and value placed on work-life balance in recent years. In some countries, legislation requires employers to respect hours outside of work, and flexible working arrangements have become more widespread, especially following the pandemic. Additionally, modern societies offer various forms of support, like unemployment benefits and childcare subsidies, that aim to relieve the burden of supporting a household through employment alone. When comparing today’s situation to that of the past, it is worth noting that previous generations often had to work longer hours under harsher conditions for their families’ survival, sometimes with little social protection. Overall, while it is true that work continues to play a major and sometimes intrusive role in people’s lives, there are also strong efforts being made to manage and mitigate its impact. I believe that although people may feel their lives are dominated by their jobs at times, there are more opportunities today than ever before to maintain a healthier balance between employment and personal life."
1287,2,It must be a woman who stays at home to care for children. Men are not suited to this kind of work. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"Traditionally in many parts of the world, it has been women who have stayed at home to care for children. This has led to the ideology and expectation that women are more suited to this type of work than men.The overwhelming status quo where women stay at home to care for the children probably derives from the fact that women are the ones who have to actually give birth to children and, following that, they are the ones who for the early part of a child’s life have to feed the child until it is weaned. In times past, this state of affairs probably led to the women assuming the permanent role of carer for the home and children, whilst men went out to work, whether it was to gather food or work in fields or factories.In spite of the fact that this became what was expected in family dynamics, it does not mean that men are necessarily less suited to caring for a child than women. It is very possible for men to care for a child, even from birth onwards in today’s world. Babies’ milk formula can be mixed by anyone and fed to a child. The fact that many women today choose not to do this again does not mean that they are better suited by nature to care for the child.Suitability for childcare is a matter for individual temperament and aptitude. Not many people, whether they are men or women, feel totally confident and knowledgeable about how to care for a baby or young child at the start. They need advice from their own mothers and fathers, midwives or from books. It is only from experience that skill with childcare comes and this skill can be acquired regardless of gender.All in all, I do not agree with the statement that men are less suited to childcare than women. I believe that aptitude to look after children is a matter of individual temperament, not gender-specific inherited qualities.",,,,,,9.0,"The belief that only women should stay at home to care for children and that men are unsuited to this role is based more on cultural tradition than any biological truth. Historically, women took on the primary caregiving responsibilities partly because of childbirth and breastfeeding, but in the modern world, these roles are less rigid. Today, men are just as capable of offering love, attention, and guidance to children as women are. Parenting skills are not automatically inherited by one gender but are developed over time through practice, patience, and learning. Many modern families choose for fathers to take on the primary caregiver role while mothers work outside the home, and these children thrive just as much as those cared for by their mothers. Furthermore, research shows that children benefit greatly from having caring, involved fathers, which suggests that men can provide nurturing and emotional support equal to that of women. While some families may choose more traditional arrangements for personal or cultural reasons, it is unfair and outdated to assume that men are naturally less suited to childcare. In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the idea that only women can stay at home with children, as both men and women have the potential to be excellent caregivers depending on their willingness, temperament, and dedication, rather than their gender."
1288,2,Many people in cities today live in high-rise apartment blocks. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this type of living?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"High-rise apartment blocks are a common sight in cities around the world. They are especially popular in large cities and in locations where building land is scarce. Living in such buildings has various advantages and disadvantages for town planners and the inhabitants themselves.The most significant advantage of high-rise apartment blocks is probably for the town planners. With land often being at a premium in large cities, one way to maximise space is to build upwards, so that the population density per square kilometre can be increased. The demand for housing in big cities can therefore be more easily met. There are also disadvantages for town planners. The heavier population density can put added pressure on social facilities, for example sewage and other waste disposal, and the provision of adequate school and medical services.There are also advantages and disadvantages for the actual inhabitants of high-rise apartment blocks. With the demand for housing being reduced, prices are therefore not as high, making housing more affordable. Many people also like not having to be responsible for a garden, and living in an apartment has this advantage. Finally, with so many people living in the same area, many friendships can be made and a community spirit can be built up. It appears the most significant disadvantage is that, in practice, living in high-rise apartment blocks is just not the lifestyle many people want. In some city neighbourhoods, these living spaces can often be associated with poor living conditions and undesirable social elements. In addition, many people view high-rise apartment blocks as being unsafe. For example, in the case of fire, tall buildings are difficult or impossible to evacuate safely.It is clear that high-rise apartment blocks have benefits and drawbacks. It is also clear, however, that due to the need to house increasing numbers of people in cities, these architectural features are here to stay, whether people like them or not.",,,,,,9.0,"High-rise apartment blocks have become an essential feature of modern urban life, with many people in cities now relying on them for accommodation. There are several advantages to this way of living, especially considering the limited space in metropolitan areas. By constructing tall buildings, city planners can provide housing for a much larger number of residents on the same footprint of land, helping to address the ever-growing demand for affordable homes. In addition, people who live in high-rise apartments often benefit from convenient access to city amenities, such as grocery stores, transportation, schools, and workplaces, which tends to make daily life easier and less dependent on private vehicles. For residents, another noticeable benefit is often the sense of security, as these buildings typically come with features like concierge services or controlled entry points. However, high-rise living is not without its drawbacks. Crowded buildings can sometimes reduce privacy, and the sheer number of occupants may make communal areas noisy or harder to maintain. High rises can also lead to feelings of isolation, as neighbors may not interact as frequently compared to people living in smaller communities. Furthermore, emergencies like power outages or elevator malfunctions can be considerably more disruptive for those on higher floors. There are also environmental concerns, as heating, cooling, and maintaining such large structures can consume significant resources. In my own experience, while visiting friends in high-rise apartments, I have seen how convenient city living can be, but I have also noticed how easy it is to feel disconnected from others. Overall, while high-rise apartments efficiently address urban housing needs and offer several conveniences, they also present challenges that must be considered when evaluating this urban lifestyle."

It is true that many people care little for clothes and scorn the importance that others attach to them; however, this does not mean that the significance that people give to fashion is a waste of time and money.When one considers that areas of the world suffer from poverty, disease and inadequate access to food and clean water, the emphasis attached to fashion by the developed world can seem out of proportion. Many people would contend that the resources put into developing and creating fashion would be more ethically spent on creating some level of equality in terms of the right to live a healthy and happy life. This point is hard to argue with. However, it is also true that people in the developed world cannot be expected to send all their spending money to people in need and that wanting to look good is an unalterable human trait.The fashion industry contributes to the society much like most other industries. It provides jobs and income to millions of people around the world and the money that changes hands generates taxes that contribute to the fabric of society. There is more to fashion than trying to look better than others and excessive luxury. The high level of fashion is indeed a kind of art form and, like other art forms, there will always be people who appreciate it, want to create it and want to spend money on it. It is part of the development of civilisation and this is not likely to change.I therefore feel that, although the gap between the rich and the poor sometimes makes it seem that fashion is a waste of time and money and an unethical use of resources, fashion is an important part of today’s society and economic output. This leads me to believe that trying to strike a balance between selfish greed and a more altruistic way of living should be an individual choice.",,,,,,9.0,"The debate over the value of fashion divides opinion, with some considering it a vibrant form of artistic expression that enriches society, while others view it as a frivolous pursuit draining time and money from more pressing needs. On one hand, supporters argue that fashion enables people to express their individuality and creativity much as painting or sculpture does, often reflecting cultural history and shifting societal values. Fashion shows, for example, can be seen as public art exhibitions showcasing designers' inventiveness, and trends can even foster a sense of community among those who share similar tastes. Additionally, the fashion industry is a critical economic driver, sustaining millions of jobs worldwide, from designers and models to manufacturers and retailers. On the other hand, critics contend that the fashion world encourages wasteful consumerism by promoting fleeting trends and pressuring individuals to constantly update their wardrobes. When weighed against global concerns such as poverty and environmental degradation, spending money and resources on ever-changing clothing styles can seem selfish and shortsighted. In my view, while it is important to be mindful of the excesses and environmental impacts of fashion, it should not be dismissed entirely as meaningless. Like other art forms, fashion has the power to inspire, uplift, and connect people, while also making significant contributions to the economy. Striking a balance between appreciating fashion’s creative and social value and remaining conscious of responsible consumption is key, and individuals can choose to engage with it thoughtfully without losing sight of broader ethical responsibilities."
1290,2,"Many people believe that studying at university is the best way to develop oneself, learn new skills and find a well-paid job. Other people believe that more is learned from getting a job straight away after school and learning whilst working.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","There are many ways to learn new knowledge and skills. Traditional educational routes, such as school followed by college or university is one route that is generally accepted and respected by today’s society. It can be argued, however, that this is not always the best way. A more vocational route can be more appropriate for certain people and for particular jobs.Universities generally have deference given to them and, due to this, most schools tailor their programs to help students get university admission. Universities usually have respected and highly qualified teachers who have the knowledge and the skills to take their students to very high levels of knowledge and expertise. The very difficulty of gaining admission, getting through the duration of the course and passing final exams ensures to employers that graduates have the necessary self-discipline, intelligence and ability to get through the courses.Universities are also particularly well suited to the teaching of various subjects, for example, medicine, law and literature and these subjects need students’ full-time attention in order to do well. Although vocational experience is necessary, a certain grounding in basic concepts to a high-level is important. Once this knowledge has been acquired, students can then integrate their knowledge with practical understanding.This, however, is not the case for all areas of learning, especially ones where the quantity of high level knowledge is not required or is possible to be learned whilst working at the same time. Young people studying to be an electrician or a plumber are good examples. To do this work well requires a lot of experience, yet also a sound understanding of theory. The learning here can be and is done working and studying at the same time, often through apprenticeships and vocational courses involving significant amounts of work experience.Therefore, in my opinion, there are more ways than one to acquire a profession. Whether learning should take place at university alone or whilst working depends on the course and the end job.",,,,,,9.0,"There are differing opinions when it comes to the best path for personal development, skill-building, and securing a well-paid career. On one hand, many people believe that attending university is the key to future success, as it provides a structured environment for acquiring detailed knowledge and recognized qualifications. These qualifications can open doors in professions like engineering or law, where a broad theoretical understanding is essential. Additionally, universities foster a diverse atmosphere where students interact with others from various backgrounds, develop independence, and learn critical thinking skills that benefit them in any job. On the other hand, some argue that starting work directly after school is more beneficial, since real-world experience is sometimes the best teacher. Working while learning can offer practical skills, on-the-job training, and a clear sense of workplace expectations. Many trades, such as plumbing or carpentry, value practical skills over academic knowledge, and people who begin these careers early often end up with less debt and more job security. Personally, I believe the choice depends on the individual and their intended career path. For jobs that demand specialized academic knowledge, university is crucial, but for roles that are skill-based, hands-on experience can be even more effective. Ultimately, society should recognize that both paths can lead to fulfillment and success, and it is important to support people in choosing the route that best matches their goals and abilities."
1291,2,The end of the world’s fossil fuel resources and the subsequent changes will be a positive development in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"Today’s society overwhelmingly depends on products made from fossil fuels. Most people would initially think about fuel for transport, but of course, fossil fuels are part of most of the fabric of life around us, from the plastics on our furniture to the pavements that we walk on. Changing our reliance on these resources can have various consequences; however, I believe that overall the society will benefit from finding viable alternatives for them.Depending on whether eco-friendly alternatives are developed, the positive effect on transport and the reduction of the associated pollution will be significant. Exhaust fumes from motor vehicles, planes and ships decrease air quality and contribute to global warming and the greenhouse effect. People’s health and the health of the planet will surely improve without these industries relying on fossil fuels. It could be that a type of transport crisis could develop as a result if society can no longer provide the power to transport so many individuals to where they want to go. This, however, does not have to be a bad thing, as it could force society to use alternative solutions, such as transport sharing and public transport development. The change in mind set has already begun. Some countries have already committed to having fossil fuel free transport and more cities are banning private vehicles from the centre of cities.Another positive development would be that more time and money would have to be put into developing renewable sources of energy, such as wind power, solar power, hydropower and tidal power. Technologies would improve and be more efficient and again, the world would use fewer sources of energy that cause pollution. This development can also be seen today, with many governments committing to proportions of their power needs coming from renewable resources.I, therefore, strongly agree with the statement that the changes from reducing reliance on fossil fuels will be positive. The only caveat is that society will need to have developed alternative sources of power rather soon, in order to avoid an energy crisis.",,,,,,9.0,"It is undeniable that fossil fuels have played a critical role in the development of modern civilization, from powering vehicles and factories to providing raw materials for a range of products. Yet, the prospect of exhausting these resources has prompted significant debate on whether such a change would ultimately help or hinder society. Personally, I strongly agree that the gradual end of the world’s dependence on fossil fuels will bring about positive changes, provided that alternative solutions are effectively embraced. First and foremost, the negative effects of fossil fuel use on the natural environment are well documented; burning coal, oil, and gas contributes to severe air pollution and accelerates climate change, resulting in melting glaciers and worsening natural disasters. The reduction of fossil fuel usage would thus likely lead to cleaner air, improved public health, and a more stable global climate. Additionally, the search for alternative energy sources has already spurred significant innovation in solar, wind, and battery technologies, which are becoming cheaper and more reliable. For instance, countries like Denmark and Costa Rica have made tremendous strides towards renewable energy usage, demonstrating that large-scale transitions are possible even for entire nations. Admittedly, the sudden disappearance of fossil fuels could disrupt industries, leading to economic challenges and the need for re-skilling workers. However, history shows that job creation in emerging green industries can offset such losses, and governments can support this transition through targeted investment and education. In summary, while the shift away from fossil fuels may bring short-term difficulties, I firmly believe the long-term social, economic, and environmental benefits far outweigh the negatives, making it a positive step for the future of society."
1292,2,"Some people feel that with the rise of artificial intelligence, computers and robots will take over the roles of teachers. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","With ever increasing technological advances, computers and robots are replacing human roles in different areas of society. This trend can also be seen in education, where interactive programs can enhance the educational experience for children and young adults. Whether, however, this revolution can also take over the role of the teacher completely is debatable, and I oppose this idea as it is unlikely to serve students well.The roles of computers and robots can be seen in many areas of the workplace. Classic examples are car factories, where a lot of the repetitive precision jobs done on assembly lines have been performed by robots for many years, and medicine, where diagnosis, and treatment, including operations, have also been assisted by computers for a long time. According to the media, it won’t also be long until we have cars that are driven automatically.It has long been discussed whether robots and computers can do this in education. It is well known that the complexity of programs can now adapt to so many situations that something can already be set up that has the required knowledge of the teacher, along with the ability to predict and answer all questions that might be asked by students. In fact, due to the nature of computers, the knowledge levels can far exceed a teacher’s and have more breadth, as a computer can have equal knowledge in all the subjects that are taught in school, as opposed to a single teacher’s specialisation. It seems very likely, therefore, that computers and robots should be able to deliver the lessons that teachers can, including various ways of differentiating and presenting materials to suit varying abilities and ages of students.Where I am not convinced is in the pastoral role of teachers. Part of teaching is managing behaviour and showing empathy with students, so that they feel cared for and important. Even if a robot or computer can be programmed to imitate these actions, students will likely respond in a different way when they know an interaction is part of an algorithm rather than based on human emotion.Therefore, although I feel that computers should be able to perform a lot of the roles of teachers in the future, they should be used as educational tools to assist teachers and not to replace them. In this way, students would receive the benefits of both ways of instruction.",,,,,,9.0,"As artificial intelligence continues to advance at a rapid pace, many people argue that computers and robots will someday replace teachers in schools. While I acknowledge that technology has the potential to significantly contribute to the educational field, I do not believe it can fully take over the unique responsibilities of human educators. Machines have already automated numerous industries, making them more efficient and less prone to human error. For example, call centers now use AI chatbots to handle routine customer inquiries, and virtual tutors can already deliver tailored lessons in subjects like mathematics. Indeed, AI can process vast amounts of information, quickly analyze student performance data, and offer instant feedback, which can be extremely beneficial in supporting teachers with lesson planning and individualized instruction. However, teaching is not simply about conveying information; it is also about fostering emotional connections, understanding students’ personal struggles, and inspiring a love for learning. Human teachers act as mentors, adapting their explanations, offering encouragement, and responding with empathy in a way that technology cannot replicate. For instance, during my school years, it was often the personal attention and understanding shown by my teachers that motivated me to overcome difficulties and develop a genuine interest in subjects I once struggled with. The presence of a caring adult can make the difference between a student succeeding or falling behind, something that algorithms and screens are unlikely to be able to provide. Therefore, I believe that while computers and robots will play an increasingly important role in education, they should be seen as valuable tools that support, rather than replace, the irreplaceable human touch offered by teachers."
1293,2,Having a salaried job is better than being self-employed. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"If one wants to work for money, there are really only two options, working for someone else for a salary and being self-employed. Most people are involved with these two options and they both have advantages and disadvantages.Being self-employed means that the worker owns the business that is being done. This might be a small one-person business or a large company with hundreds of employees. The first advantage of this is the capacity to earn more money. If the business does very well, the income can be considerable and the owner of the company will receive the benefits. On the other hand, if business is not good, the owner’s income will be low. Self-employed people also have the benefit to some extent of choosing their working hours and holidays and they have the right to change anything within their business. With this autonomy, however, comes the pressure to succeed and the reliance on one’s employees, if there are any, to do their best to make the business thrive.Salaried workers do not experience the same stress as the self-employed owners of companies. They might have stress in their duties, but the pressure that comes with keeping one’s own business operating successfully in order to support oneself and one’s family is just not felt by an employee. The employee also has a certain knowledge of his or her income, as the salary is usually fixed every month. The self-employed owner’s income often depends on how successful the business is. The employee’s fixed income, however, does not give much scope for earning large amounts more. In addition, an employee does not have the freedoms of the owner or the autonomy, and for many people, having control over their lives is a significant factor to their well-being.It is certain that there are advantages and disadvantages for both being self-employed and salaried. I personally disagree that being salaried is better than being self-employed. I prefer the autonomy that being self-employed brings and, although there is more risk and pressure, this can lead to greater and more fulfilling rewards.",,,,,,9.0,"The comparison between holding a salaried job and being self-employed is an important topic for many people considering their career paths, and both options offer unique benefits and drawbacks. Having a salaried position typically provides stability and predictability; employees receive a fixed paycheck at regular intervals, making it easier to budget and plan for the future. Additionally, many salaried jobs come with benefits such as health insurance, paid holidays, and retirement savings programs. These perks can safeguard employees from unexpected expenses such as medical emergencies or periods of unemployment. However, a salaried job often comes with less flexibility, as workers must adhere to company rules and fixed schedules, which can sometimes result in less satisfaction or sense of autonomy. In contrast, self-employed individuals enjoy a greater degree of independence, as they can choose when and how to work, make their own decisions about business methods, and potentially earn more if their ventures are successful. Yet, this freedom also brings significant challenges, including inconsistent income, lack of employee benefits, and the pressure of being responsible for every aspect of the business. While salaried jobs offer security and predictability, self-employment allows for innovation and personal growth. Personally, I believe that neither option is strictly better than the other; the choice depends on an individual’s personality, goals, and risk tolerance. Some people thrive on routine and prefer the safety net of a regular salary, while others are motivated by the excitement and autonomy of being their own boss. Ultimately, each should weigh the benefits and sacrifices of each employment type before deciding which suits their lifestyle best."
1294,2,Some people feel that learning a foreign language is an essential component of a child’s education. Others feel that learning a foreign language is often a waste of time that can be better spent on learning about technology and other more vocational subjects.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"Throughout the history of education, learning a foreign language or languages has been a constant component. Of course, many people feel that this is really an unnecessary part of education for everyone, but this is not a point of view that I share.The opponents to learning a foreign language might argue that most people do not travel that often outside their own country. In addition to this, out of all the countries of the world, comparatively not many share the same language. Therefore, learning a foreign language will only be useful for the very limited time that one spends in a country where this language is used. For some people, the language might never be used in their entire lives. When one thinks about how much time and money are spent training language teachers, buying resources, going on trips and delivering lessons for such a negligible benefit, this would seem to be a very inefficient allocation of resources.However, the benefits of learning a foreign language go further than just the ability to use it from time to time on a holiday or business trip. Firstly, through learning one language, one gains an understanding to some extent of how all languages work. Thus, no matter where people might end up around the world, the knowledge of language can be of use. Secondly, with the study of a foreign language, one also opens oneself up to other cultures. This allows in turn an appreciation for different points of view and belief systems. With an ever-shrinking world due to globalisation, the ability to empathise and understand the people from other countries is vital to reducing conflict and creating a more tolerant society. Finally, quite simply learning languages is excellent for the improvement of general cognitive skills.It seems to me that learning a foreign language, therefore, is more than just gaining the ability to speak a few words of a foreign tongue. It is part of intellectual and social development and needs to be continued for everyone in today’s schools.",,,,,,9.0,"In modern education, the question of whether studying a foreign language should be considered essential or unnecessary often sparks debate. Those who argue against it suggest that valuable classroom time would be better used studying technical and practical subjects which are highly relevant in the current job market. They point out that not everyone will need to use a different language in their lives, and that most people can get by using technology like translation apps or simply relying on the growing dominance of English. These individuals see language lessons as outdated, especially when compared to learning skills that could lead directly to employment, such as coding or mechanics. Nonetheless, I believe the benefits of foreign language learning extend well beyond simple conversation. Acquiring a new language strengthens mental flexibility, improves memory, and helps develop better multitasking abilities. Furthermore, learning a language exposes young people to new cultures and ways of thinking, which is especially important in our interconnected world. This exposure can lead to greater tolerance and understanding among different peoples, something that is arguably just as important as technical skills in ensuring harmony and cooperation. From my own experience, studying French in secondary school not only made traveling easier, but also inspired a curiosity about history, art, and literature I might not have developed otherwise. In conclusion, while learning about technology and job-oriented subjects is essential in today’s world, learning a foreign language offers cognitive, social, and cultural benefits that are irreplaceable and should remain a key part of every child's education."
1295,2,"With the vast increase in online resources today, libraries with print books are not a necessity for today’s society.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","It is indeed true that digital resources today far outstrip what can be put and stored in print books. Almost any kind of book can now be accessed digitally and those that can’t be will soon be changed to a digital format. Some people, therefore, believe that libraries with print books are no longer needed.If one looks at this issue dispassionately, it seems far more logical that people now should only read books digitally. It only requires a single computer or electronic reader and an individual can have access to the history of literature and works on all other fields. The costs involved with setting, typing, printing and distributing print books would practically disappear and this would make things more convenient and much cheaper. An actual library building would be totally unnecessary, as all one would need would be a ‘virtual library’ as a website and all works could be accessed through this portal. There would not even be any need to leave the house to gain access to anything one needed. This would seem to be the most logical way of proceeding.Logic, however, is not always the best approach to everything. Print books have a long history with humanity and our relationship with real books is not something that can be changed overnight. Many people, including younger readers, feel that there is something special about having a book with real paper and needing to turn pages. There will therefore for the time being be a future for print books and libraries.Libraries will continue to be especially important, as not all older people use computers and e-readers as much as the younger generation. They will still want to read print books and the library is a cheap and convenient place to find them. In addition, if only a few books in print are available in the future, libraries might be one of the few places where they might be accessed. Another purpose that libraries serve is acting as community centres that organise events, education and childcare. Ironically, libraries also provide computers and Internet access for people who cannot afford their own.In spite of the seeming dominance to come of digital books, I feel that there is and will be a place for libraries with print books. This state of affairs might change in the future, but at present, they are important community resources.",,,,,,9.0,"While it is undeniable that online resources have dramatically changed the way we access information, I do not fully agree that libraries with print books have become redundant in today's society. Firstly, libraries offer far more than just the books themselves; they provide a quiet, focused environment that encourages reading and learning, which can be difficult to replicate at home amid digital distractions. For many people, especially the elderly or those from less privileged backgrounds, reliable access to technology is not always guaranteed. Libraries bridge this digital divide, offering access not only to print materials but also to computers and the Internet for those who need it. Furthermore, the physicality of a print book can enhance the reading experience; the act of turning pages, highlighting text, or simply escaping from a screen can make learning more engaging and enjoyable. From my own experience as a student, I have found that studying from printed texts often helps with retention and comprehension, as it allows for annotation and easier navigation between sections. Libraries also play an important social and cultural role, hosting events, workshops, and study groups, which foster a sense of community that virtual resources cannot replace. While digital materials are unquestionably valuable for their accessibility and convenience, I believe that libraries with print books continue to serve vital educational, social, and practical purposes, and their presence still enriches society in ways that simply going online cannot."
1296,2,It is the responsibility of individuals to save and provide for their own retirement. Governments have no obligation to provide this benefit.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"The responsibility for providing funds for retirement is incredibly important and something that is often overlooked by younger people. Some believe it is the responsibility of the individual to plan for this, but others feel it is the responsibility of the state.People who believe that the state should be responsible for funding retirees, base their argument on the fact that in most countries, people pay taxes and social charges to the government. This money, they argue, should also go towards the provision of a pension for the person paying the tax. In addition, those who have very small or no income, pay little or no tax and do not have the ability to provide for themselves. The government, therefore, in its role of caring for the population, has an obligation to pay a pension and provide other social benefits, such as medical treatment.Many others, however, feel that it is the responsibility of individuals to fund their own retirements. As adults, they argue, people should be able to set aside and invest money throughout their lifetime, so that they can retire with few financial worries. In many countries the government has legislated a framework allowing and encouraging citizens to save up and accumulate sufficient funds for the period after their working years have ended.I neither agree nor disagree with the statement, but rather my opinion takes in parts of both arguments. I feel that people should be responsible for saving money to fund their retirement, but I also feel that individuals who have not had the chance to do so should be supported by the government out of taxes. In my view, therefore, it is wrong to say that governments have no obligation to help people in this area. Governments are there to support the entire population of their countries, which includes the poorer elements of society.",,,,,,9.0,"The question of whether individuals alone should bear the responsibility for their own retirement, or whether governments should play a role, is highly debated. On one hand, it is reasonable to argue that people should plan for their future and put aside money during their working years, as this encourages financial independence and personal discipline. For instance, with better financial education and access to savings plans, many workers can accumulate enough resources for a comfortable retirement. However, this approach does not account for those who face obstacles beyond their control, such as unemployment, illness, or unexpected family responsibilities, which can make saving for retirement extremely difficult or even impossible. Furthermore, in many countries, people pay taxes throughout their lives with the expectation that the government will provide at least a basic safety net in old age. It seems unjust to ignore the needs of those who, despite their best efforts, simply cannot save enough. Personally, I believe a balanced approach is fair: individuals who are able should certainly take steps to provide for themselves, but governments also have a duty to offer support to those in genuine need. This might include a basic public pension and access to affordable healthcare, ensuring no one is left destitute in their later years. Therefore, while personal responsibility is important, I disagree with the idea that governments have no obligation at all; a society is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable members, including the elderly."
1297,2,Many cities have areas where the only cars are taxis and buses.Is this a positive or a negative development? What are the effects of this on individuals and society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"Banning cars from the centre of various cities around the world has been a strategy to reduce pollution and encourage people to use public transport. It has had various positive effects for both individuals and for society as a whole.Banning cars from the centre of cities seems to be a very positive development. Fewer cars on the road means less pollution and fewer fossil fuel resources being used up. Although the effect on resources might be relatively negligible, it can create a newer way of thinking regarding the dynamics of transport within cities and this could be the most important benefit to society. Some people working in the centre of these cities may complain about inconvenience, but many would agree that this is a small price to pay.A reduction in the reliance of people on private vehicles is likely to encourage them to use public transport or even bicycles. Using public transport, especially the types that run on clean sources of power, will significantly raise air quality levels in cities, which will of course benefit everyone. The clean air could even further encourage the use of bicycles, which would in turn promote more healthy lifestyles and less obesity. This would contribute on an individual level to people’s well-being and a better and longer life, and on a societal level, it would lessen the strain on public health resources. Governments could encourage this by creating more bicycle lanes to make cycling easier and safer.In conclusion, it is clear that banning cars from the centre of cities is significantly beneficial. Better health and ecology, as well as improvement in longevity and well-being can benefit individuals and the entire society.",,,,,,9.0,"The decision to designate certain city areas exclusively for taxis and buses is, in my view, largely a positive development, both for individuals and for society at large. One of the primary advantages is the reduction in traffic congestion and air pollution, which is a pressing concern in urban environments. When only taxis and buses are allowed in certain zones, the volume of vehicles decreases greatly, leading to smoother traffic flow and shorter journey times for public transport users. Furthermore, this change often encourages more people to use mass transit instead of personal cars, making public transportation a more reliable and attractive option. This shift can also help to lower carbon emissions, contributing to cleaner air and a healthier environment, which benefits everyone, especially children and elderly residents who are more vulnerable to the effects of pollution. Of course, there can be downsides for individuals who are accustomed to the convenience of driving their own vehicles everywhere, such as having to adjust their travel habits or spend more time transferring between transport modes. However, the broader gains, such as improved public health, increased physical activity if people walk more, and a less stressful urban environment, outweigh these inconveniences. For example, in my own city, the bus- and taxi-only streets have become more pleasant and safer for pedestrians and cyclists, and local businesses have even reported increased foot traffic. Overall, limiting certain areas to taxis and buses yields important benefits for quality of life and environmental sustainability, and these advantages are likely to strengthen as cities continue to prioritize the well-being of their residents."
1298,2,Many schoolchildren today take part in work experience sessions for short periods of time instead of attending school. Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"It has been a popular trend for some time now to put children into what can be called ‘work experience placements’. The children are taken out of school and take part in various types of work, usually for around a week. Some people criticise this trend, but I can’t see how it can be a negative experience.One of the criticisms is that children lose a week of schoolwork. With the pressure to do well at school increasing, children need every bit of help to maximise their potential. Taking them out of the school, it is therefore argued, stops them from getting access to needed education for a whole week. As the students won’t really be of much help to a workplace for just one week, it would therefore be better for them to remain at school.While this is a valid point, taking a child’s entire experience of school into account, a single week away does not make a significant difference. Indeed, if the timing of the week’s work placements is done correctly, the week can also serve as a kind of ‘holiday’ away from school, something that is regularly needed in order to allow students to remain fresh and enthusiastic. In many work placements, children also get to see some of things they learn at school put into a realistic context, allowing them to understand the relevance of what they learn and thereby creating a way to reinforce the learning.In addition to this, schoolchildren can be quite nervous about the world of work that they will have to join at some point in their lives. By getting this short taste of what it is like, they can see that it is nothing to be scared about. As well as this, children will often have some ideas of what they want to do for a living, but are not sure. By allowing them to see a type of work they are considering, they are better able to decide whether that career could be suitable for them.I feel, therefore, that work placements can be seen as a positive development. Missing a short amount of school is not serious and the benefits that can be gained from the placements are significant.",,,,,,9.0,"In recent years, it has become increasingly common for schoolchildren to participate in short-term work experience programs instead of attending their usual classes. Some critics argue that this trend could be harmful because it interrupts the flow of education and might leave children behind in their academic studies. They believe that with educational standards becoming ever more demanding, even a brief absence from school can impact a child’s progress, and since young students may not be able to contribute meaningfully to a workplace in such a short time, the value of the experience is questioned. However, I believe that the benefits of these work placements far outweigh the drawbacks. Firstly, spending a few days or a week in a real work environment can offer students a unique opportunity to develop practical skills that classrooms or textbooks alone cannot provide. For example, through work experience, students gain communication skills, learn about teamwork, and witness firsthand the kind of discipline required in a job. In addition, being exposed to different professions can help guide children as they consider their future options and identify what type of work excites or suits them best. While it is true that a small amount of schoolwork is missed, the life lessons and increased motivation students often return with can enrich their overall approach to learning. Personally, I remember classmates who came back from work experience placements feeling much more confident and interested in their studies because they could see how academic learning applied to actual careers. In conclusion, I am convinced that short periods of work experience provide invaluable insights and skills, making such programs a highly positive development for schoolchildren."
1299,2,The number of advertisements for charities on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. What is causing this? Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"It indeed appears true that the frequency with which advertisements for charities appear both on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. There can be various explanations for this and it can be seen in both a positive and negative light.One explanation for the increase in the number of charity advertisements is that the charities themselves are becoming more aggressive in their marketing. This can also be seen in the common strategy nowadays to encourage a monthly donation, rather than a one-off donation. The increased marketing is apparent too in the increased numbers of ‘street salespeople’, who stop passersby and try to get them to commit to this monthly payment.A second reason for the increase could also be that there have been more charities started and the number of advertisements would therefore increase and become more noticeable. If these charities are all legitimate, this would mean that more help will be getting to causes that need it. The increase in charities could also be explained by a possible increase of humanitarian awareness. People might be now adopting different ideologies that take into account people in less advantageous positions.If the number of advertisements for charities has risen due to the fact that there has been a positive shift in people’s compassionate principles, this surely has to be seen as an optimistic development. If it is due to the fact that governments have been cutting back, it could be seen as a pessimistic development. In addition, if there are more charities asking for more money, this will inevitably mean that the amount of money donated will have to be more thinly spread, which would be a negative development.There could be several reasons for why there are more charity advertisements today. Whatever the reasons, as long as any money is helping people in disadvantageous positions, it must be seen as a positive development.",,,,,,9.0,"There has been a noticeable surge in charity advertisements, both on television and across various Internet platforms, and several factors can be identified as causes of this development. One of the primary reasons is the increasing accessibility and popularity of digital media, which allows charities to reach a larger and more diverse audience than ever before. At the same time, as more people become exposed to global crises through constant news updates and social media, public awareness of humanitarian issues has grown, prompting more individuals to consider supporting charitable causes. In response to greater competition for donations, charities are investing more in sophisticated advertising campaigns to distinguish themselves and compel potential donors to contribute. However, this trend can have both positive and negative consequences. On the positive side, the greater visibility of charity ads means more people are informed about important issues like poverty, disease, and environmental challenges, which may lead to increased donations and positive social change. On the negative side, the proliferation of charity advertisements can sometimes lead to donor fatigue, where individuals feel overwhelmed by constant requests for help and become less likely to donate. Furthermore, the presence of fraudulent organizations poses a risk to genuine charities, as it can erode public trust. Despite these drawbacks, the overall increase in charity advertising reflects society’s growing willingness to support those in need. As long as people remain vigilant about which charities they choose to support, the surge in advertisement can be seen as a largely positive development, as it mobilizes more resources to assist vulnerable populations."

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","The benefits of giving or not giving homework to children are often debated. Some people feel that children have enough work to do during one day whilst at school, whereas others feel that the more work set, the better.It is true that schools today place more and more demands and pressure on children. The competition to do well, to enter a good university and to get a good job is significant. This has led to the ideology that children should do as much schoolwork as possible in order to help their intellectual development. The argument, however, that more is better is not always valid. There comes a point, especially for a child, when more knowledge cannot be absorbed in a day. When a child has possibly 7 or 8 classes a day on different subjects, he or she is processing a lot of information already. To give more work to be done at home, therefore, would be pointless and even counterproductive. In addition to this, although it is important to be educated, childhood should also be a time when there is an opportunity to just play and enjoy unstructured time. Homework can significantly lessen the possibilities of doing this.On the other hand, it can be argued that there is a place for homework. If study at school is not overdone, the opportunity to look at work again and extend ideas can be an invaluable exercise. It’s easy to forget one thing that has been taught once, but if that concept is revisited a second time, the brain has time to reprocess and likely better understand and remember.It seems to me that there is a place for homework for today’s children. What must be remembered, though, is that homework needs to be limited to age-appropriate parameters, so that a balance can be struck between study and free time and relaxation.",,,,,,9.0,"The issue of whether school children should be assigned homework is a topic that has sparked much debate among educators and parents alike. Some people argue that homework can serve as an unnecessary burden, especially after a long and demanding day at school. They note that children need time to relax, socialize, and pursue hobbies, which are all important for healthy emotional and social development. For instance, having hours of homework each evening can lead to stress, sleep deprivation, and less opportunity for families to spend time together. On the other hand, supporters of homework believe that it reinforces what students have learned in class and helps to develop good study habits and self-discipline. For example, completing assignments at home can aid children in reviewing key concepts and learning to manage their time effectively—a valuable skill for future academic and professional success. Personally, I believe that the ideal approach lies somewhere in between these two views. While it is valuable for students to have opportunities to revisit material outside the classroom, the quantity and difficulty of homework should be carefully considered and tailored to each age group. Too much homework can have negative consequences, yet a reasonable amount, guided by thoughtful instruction, can enhance learning without overwhelming students or infringing on their personal lives. Ultimately, homework should support a balanced lifestyle, fostering both academic growth and overall well-being."
1301,2,It is a fact that the majority of people who are sent to prison commit further crime after their release.What is causing this? What can be done to change this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"It is a sad fact that criminals who leave prison go on to commit further crime. There are various reasons for this, but there are also some things that can be done to prevent it from happening.One reason for this recidivism is due to a lack of legitimate income. Many people turn to crime as they cannot find an alternative to earn money. When such person comes out of prison, it is very often the case that they have the same few opportunities for a legitimate income. In fact, these opportunities will even be reduced, as employers are often less willing to give an ex-prisoner a job. Some people also return to crime, as they spend all the time of their prison sentence with other criminals. This is not a great environment for rehabilitation, and sometimes even a network of contacts can be made to help develop criminal activities on release.One important way to help address this problem is education. Criminals who have turned to illegal activities because of no alternatives to earn a living need to learn a way to earn a wage, such as a trade or vocational skills. Computer skills, for example, are in high demand and someone trained in these could very possibly find work. In addition, governments can offer incentives to employers to attract them to give jobs to newly-released prisoners. This would help people who don’t really want to return to crime achieve a fresh start. As keeping people in prison is an expensive business, governments might find it cheaper to pay these incentives.To sum up, people returning to crime is a tragedy that should be avoided if at all possible in today’s society. Education and incentives can directly address the reasons for it and could make society a happier and safer place.",,,,,,9.0,"The unfortunate reality that many former prisoners resume offending after their release is driven by a combination of social and systemic issues. Firstly, prison can isolate individuals from society, severing family ties and reducing social support when they return. Furthermore, being labeled as an ""ex-convict"" often leads to widespread discrimination in the job market, meaning that employment—crucial for rebuilding one’s life—is hard to secure for people with a criminal record. Without a stable source of income, some feel forced back into criminal activity to survive. The environment within prisons can also exacerbate the problem; instead of being places of reform, prisons often surround inmates with others immersed in criminal lifestyles, making it easy to adopt negative behaviors. If nothing is done, this cycle is likely to continue. However, there are several steps that could address these root causes. Providing meaningful rehabilitation programs, such as counseling and mental health support, within prisons can tackle underlying problems like addiction, which drive some people to crime. Additionally, governments could implement job training and apprenticeships tailored to the needs of ex-offenders, not only to build employable skills but also to give hope and direction. Partnerships with businesses that are willing to hire former prisoners, perhaps in exchange for tax benefits, could also improve job prospects. Community support—such as mentoring and transitional housing—can help individuals adjust after release. If society is willing to invest in such measures, it is likely that recidivism rates would decrease, promoting safer communities and better lives for those re-entering society."
1302,2,"Social media has become a real problem for some young people today, and governments should create laws that allow only people over 18 years of age to have accounts.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","Social media today is extremely significant to a majority of the population, especially the younger generation. Many teenagers find it exceptionally convenient and necessary for communication and entertainment. However, not everyone is able to use social media responsibly, which gave rise to the idea of making it accessible to only those older than eighteen years of age.Though there are negatives, such as cyber-bullying, or being too distracted by these modern media, there are issues surrounding most things in life. It is a choice to go onto a social media website, and many younger people are capable of managing accounts without any difficulties. It is not the government’s responsibility to monitor under eighteen-year olds; that is for the parents.Statistics show that over eighty per cent of teens use a form of online social media. It allows them to chat online, easily stay in contact with friends and family across the world, and see updates on others’ lives (through text, photos or videos). Social media is a way to express thoughts or ideas and to stay in contact with the rest of the world.To not permit one of the largest Internet-using demographics to use social media because a few people have problems with it is an irrational and an unfair restriction. Not only would profit be lost with fewer users, but controlling who creates accounts and monitoring proof of age would be difficult as well. I believe that laws should not make social media inaccessible to young people under eighteen; this would be unnecessary and absurd.",,,,,,9.0,"The debate about whether only adults over the age of eighteen should be allowed to use social media has intensified as more young people face problems online. While concerns about cyberbullying, privacy risks, and internet addiction are real, I do not believe that creating strict age laws is the best solution. Social media plays a huge role in teenagers’ daily lives, offering essential opportunities for communication, self-expression, and education. Many young people rely on these platforms to connect with peers, learn about current events, and even work on school projects together. If governments ban everyone under eighteen from having an account, this would unfairly penalize responsible teenagers and cut them off from these important benefits. Instead of lawmakers imposing age restrictions, parents should play a lead role in supervising and guiding their children’s online behavior. Furthermore, enforcing such an age law would be extremely difficult, as young people can easily falsify their age or use someone else’s information, making the restriction ineffective in practice. For example, most social media platforms already require users to be at least thirteen, yet millions of younger children still have accounts. Rather than relying on new laws, a better approach would involve schools teaching online safety and responsibility, as well as giving parents better tools to protect their kids. Therefore, I believe that a law prohibiting young people from using social media until they are eighteen is not reasonable or practical, and more nuanced solutions should be considered to address the real issues."
1303,2,"With the scale of globalisation today, it would be of unquestioned benefit to have a single world currency.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","Globalisation has become a significant aspect of the world’s modern economy, with countless industries and businesses expanding in various countries. This has led to the debate of developing a world currency with many people believing it could drastically help further develop economies and assist in the development of many countries.A worldwide currency could bring on effects similar to when Euro was developed for Europe. Trade could be significantly encouraged, as there would be no exchange rate fluctuation risks between different currencies. Moreover, tourists would not need to exchange money when travelling.However, there are certain risks to a global currency, which definitely do not make it an “unquestioned benefit”. Countries in debt would not be able to lower their currency value to make consumer goods more desirable, which could develop into a severe economic issue. For example, the US regulated its interest rates to increase the money resources in order to diminish the effect of a recent recession. Also economic problems, such as in Greece, have actually been made worse by the use of the common Euro. If applied worldwide, many countries’ economies could be very similarly negatively impacted. Finally, many countries around the world do not have a stable enough economy to be able to enter a common currency. If weaker countries were to adopt a world currency, this could be disastrous to their economy and to the economies of other countries using the same currency.In conclusion, the extent to which a global currency would be beneficial is quite low. It seems to me that the risks outweigh the benefits, as if a country were to lose economic stability, the world would be impacted as well. For that reason, I feel that in present circumstances, it is best to have separate currencies to protect countries from economic recession.",,,,,,9.0,"As globalisation deepens and countries interact more frequently through trade and tourism, the idea of adopting a single world currency has become increasingly appealing to some. Proponents argue that a universal currency would eliminate complicated conversions, boost international business by removing exchange rate uncertainties, and make travel more convenient. The adoption of the Euro in Europe is often cited as a successful example, with smoother trade relationships and greater transparency in prices across member states. However, despite these attractions, numerous drawbacks suggest that a single world currency is not an unquestioned benefit. Economies around the globe vary greatly in strength and stability, and one monetary policy cannot suit every country’s needs. For example, during financial crises, nations often need to control their own currency’s value or set independent interest rates to address local problems, as seen when the UK adjusted monetary policies during the 2008 financial downturn. Moreover, countries with weaker economies could face severe economic difficulties, as happened to Greece and other southern European nations following the adoption of the Euro, when they could not devalue their currency to regain competitiveness. Imposing a world currency might magnify such problems at a global scale, risking widespread economic hardship if the system failed. In conclusion, while a single world currency might seem advantageous in simplifying international transactions, the loss of economic independence and the risks for struggling economies mean that its overall benefit is questionable. Therefore, maintaining separate currencies remains a safer approach in our interconnected yet diverse world economy."
1304,2,"In some countries, boys and girls are educated separately after the age of about ten years old. Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","In many countries around the world, boys and girls are educated together. There is a group of countries, however, that educate boys and girls separately. This is frequently done on religious grounds, but not always. Having such a system can produce various advantages and disadvantages.One of the principal reasons for educating boys and girls separately is that, if they are together, they can distract each other. After puberty, boys can be strongly attracted to girls and vice versa, and this can result in disruptive conduct in the classroom as, for example, they show off to one another. Separating boys and girls can therefore have the distinct advantage of reducing this disturbing behaviour. However, some teachers have pointed out that this model does not always work, and that separated boys and girls are equally disruptive in class, and sometimes more so. These teachers say that having the opposite sex in the classroom can actually improve behaviour.Many educators also believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs. Separating boys and girls can allow teachers to address these needs more easily. There is also a belief that single sex schools allow gender stereotypes to be challenged and therefore education aspirations can be broadened.A major disadvantage of separating boys and girls in education is that the children miss important formative behavioural development when they do not have interaction with the other gender on a regular basis. This can lead to shyness and, more seriously, dysfunctional relationships later in life. Some people also feel that mixed sex schools can promote gender stereotypes rather than reducing them.In conclusion, I feel that children should be educated all together, although I would respect a system in which they are separated due to religious beliefs. My personal opinion is that different genders should learn to interact together from an early age, as this would allow them to develop healthy working relationships with each other.",,,,,,9.0,"Some countries choose to educate boys and girls separately once they reach around ten years old, believing this creates a better learning environment. Supporters of this system argue that by splitting students by gender, schools are able to focus on each group’s educational strengths and weaknesses, allowing teachers to design more effective lessons. For example, some claim that girls tend to mature faster than boys during adolescence and may benefit from a different teaching approach, while boys might feel more comfortable and participate more actively in a boys-only class. In addition, advocates point out that separating boys and girls can reduce distractions caused by romantic interests and social pressures, helping students to concentrate more on their studies. However, opponents of single-gender education argue that this separation can limit opportunities for boys and girls to develop important social skills. They maintain that mixed classes better reflect the real world, where both men and women must work and communicate together. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that exposure to diverse perspectives within the classroom helps challenge stereotypes and broadens students’ understanding of each other. I believe that although single-sex education may offer some advantages in terms of focus and customized teaching, it is ultimately more beneficial for boys and girls to learn together. Encouraging interaction and cooperation from a young age prepares students for life beyond school, fostering mutual respect and understanding between genders."
1305,2,Everybody today should pay a small amount from their income in order to help people who are homeless and / or suffering great poverty. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"Homelessness and poverty is a terrible but topical issue in both more economically advanced and less industrialised countries. To deal with this, many people feel that a small proportion of everyone’s income should be used to aid the homeless and poor. This could create more opportunities and change the lives of many disadvantaged people for the better.Though there are certain facilities such as shelters and soup kitchens to aid the poor and homeless, it is clear that this is not enough. In the U.S. alone, a very developed country in itself, nearly two million people are homeless. These facilities can lend a helpful hand; however, they do not help eradicate the problem. Those people who are homeless or poor can have trouble finding jobs, or, if they are lucky to gain employment, the pay may not be enough to support them and their families.If a small percentage of everyone’s income was used to help build more aid facilities and fund organisations to help the homeless and poor, the suffering of many people could be alleviated. However, this is not a perfect world, and taxes are high enough for many people. A similar argument could be that a portion of the taxes already paid to the government should then be set aside for this cause, but of course government funds are usually stretched to breaking point as it is, as governments have so many financial responsibilities already.Though the fundamental idea that people should pay a small percentage of their income to help the homeless and poor is admirable, it is unlikely that enough people would agree to it. People need all the money they earn after taxes anyway and, although governments already have too many calls on their available funds, in my view they should prioritise support payments for the homeless.",,,,,,9.0,"The question of whether everyone should contribute a part of their income to support those facing homelessness and severe poverty is a topic that sparks many opinions. On one hand, there is a moral argument that as members of a society, individuals have a collective responsibility to look after those who are less fortunate. By pooling a small percentage of everyone's income, substantial funds could be raised to provide vital services such as shelter, food, and healthcare, potentially improving quality of life for many people. In places where I live, community programs funded by donations and taxes have shown a positive impact, offering not only immediate relief but also education and job training, which help people reintegrate into society. However, it is also true that many individuals already face financial pressures from taxes and day-to-day necessities, making additional deductions from their income difficult to accept. Furthermore, there are concerns that money collected in this way may not always be distributed effectively, as bureaucratic systems sometimes prevent resources from reaching those who need them most. Some argue that governments should better allocate existing tax revenues rather than asking people to contribute even more. Despite these concerns, I believe that if managed transparently and efficiently, a small, collective contribution could make a measurable difference in alleviating poverty and homelessness. The key is ensuring that the system is fair, accountable, and complemented by long-term solutions that address the root causes of poverty."
1306,2,Every household should have a government-imposed limit on the amount of rubbish it can throw away. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"The amount of waste people produce can be quite shocking, with every person generating kilograms of rubbish in a single day, and all this can be difficult to manage. This has given some people the idea that there should be a limitation on the amount of rubbish produced per household; however, opinions are divided as to whether this would be the the most effective option.Having a limitation on the amount of waste produced sounds like a fine solution to a significant problem, with over two hundred and fifty million tons being generated in 2016 by the U.S. alone. Taxing households that break limits would push people to produce less waste and make them more mindful of what can be recycled or composted. However, forcing people to produce less waste might not be attainable.Households produce as much waste as they need to live their lifestyles. The waste people generate is only a result of the products they purchase, and will most likely wish to continue to purchase. Taxing people may be a cause of resentment, with many of them already struggling to pay their usual bills. In addition, if people produce more than they are allowed, this will encourage littering and dumping, so that they are not caught with more waste than entitled, and this in turn will damage the environment.Though controlling the amount of waste produced is important, there could be other ways of encouraging lesser output. In my opinion, governments should encourage composting and recycling, which will also reduce wasted material. People should also be more aware of what waste they produce and how it can be reduced. An education drive on these issues would perhaps be more likely to succeed in reducing rubbish than imposing limitations.",,,,,,9.0,"There is little doubt that excessive household waste has become a major problem in many parts of the world, prompting some to argue that governments should introduce strict limits on the amount of rubbish each home can dispose of. While I agree that reducing waste is crucial for protecting the environment, I do not think government-imposed limits are practical or necessarily fair. On one hand, setting a maximum amount of rubbish per household could certainly encourage people to think more carefully about the products they buy and increase efforts in recycling and composting. This would benefit landfills, help lower pollution, and perhaps encourage companies to offer greener packaging. However, not all households are the same in terms of size, needs, and living circumstances. For instance, large families or those with babies often produce more waste through no fault of their own, and penalizing them could be seen as unjust. Furthermore, strict limits might inadvertently lead to illegal dumping, with people discarding excess trash in unsafe or inappropriate places just to avoid fines. Instead of setting rigid limits, I believe governments should focus on offering incentives for reducing waste and making recycling easier and more accessible. Educational campaigns about the environmental impact of rubbish and clear labeling on recyclable materials would also be highly effective. In summary, while the intention behind rubbish limits is understandable, a more balanced approach that encourages, rather than forces, people to change their habits would likely be better in the long run."
1307,2,The fact that enormous sums are paid for pieces of art is not acceptable at a time when many people around the world live in poverty. Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"It is true that pieces of art in today’s world can change hands for enormous sums. Works by artists such as Picasso, da Vinci and Rembrandt have been sold for millions of dollars. Recently, a Modigliani was sold to a billionaire for one hundred and seventy million dollars. It certainly seems obscene that such figures are spent when many people around the world live in poverty.The work of many charities would be transformed by the money generated by just one of these art sales and in turn, the lives of ordinary people in need would be transformed. Medicines, food and shelter amongst other things could easily be provided, saving lots of lives, many of which would be children. When the issue is looked at from this point of view, the art sales world certainly seems obscene.However, in my opinion, things are unlikely to change. Human greed is endemic and people who have the drive to earn that amount of money and who actually have access to these sums in cash are not often people who will part with their wealth. Lots of prosperous people support many charities, but it is unlikely that they would completely relinquish their access to the luxuries that accompany their lives. The works of art are also often seen as investments in themselves, to be held on to for a period of time and then resold at a profit.In conclusion, in an ideal world, the vast sums of money that are spent on fine and rare works of art would be better spent on helping those in need. In reality, however, this is unlikely to take place.",,,,,,9.0,"It is often argued that spending huge amounts of money on works of art is unacceptable when countless people around the world are struggling to meet basic needs. Paintings by famous artists regularly fetch millions at auction, while there are communities that cannot access clean water or adequate healthcare. From a moral standpoint, this disparity is troubling, as the funds used for a single piece of art could dramatically improve the quality of life for many individuals. Organizations providing disaster relief or educational programs, for example, might accomplish much with just a fraction of these art sales. Despite this, it is important to consider the reasons why extravagant art purchases persist. Many individuals who acquire expensive art view it not only as a symbol of status, but also as a safe investment or even a way to support the preservation of cultural heritage. Some wealthy collectors do make significant charitable donations, but it is unlikely that the majority would redirect all their spending from art to humanitarian causes. Moreover, the art market itself sustains jobs and generates revenue for museums, galleries, and artists, which means that a complete halt to such transactions could have negative economic impacts. Ultimately, while it would be admirable if more funds were allocated towards alleviating poverty instead of acquiring luxury items, it is improbable that art sales of this scale will cease. Therefore, while I believe that society has a responsibility to address poverty more aggressively, it is unrealistic to expect that the art market alone will bridge this gap."
1308,2,Professional sportsmen and sportswomen and professional entertainers can often command enormous salaries today and this situation reflects society’s dependence on being entertained.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"It is no secret that today’s entertainment industry is extremely popular, with nearly everyone being engaged at some time in watching TV shows, movies and sports games. The North American sports industry alone generates a massive $67.7 billion every year. With the present emphasis on entertainment, sportsmen and women and professional entertainers can earn enormous salaries, with figures in the millions for one game, appearance or film. This situation certainly does reflect today’s society’s obsession with entertainment.Many people argue that celebrities do not deserve such payment when work in other professions considered of equal or higher value to society is underpaid. A-list celebrities can make over $20 million per movie, whilst many average workers can barely make ends meet. Of course there are lots of people who say that there are better ways the money could be used, rather than allowing such a vast amount to go to just one person. This is a fairly naive point of view, though. So long as people wish to watch entertainment, advertising in turn will be present and the most watched celebrities will be able to earn high salaries, as their presence will ensure the high viewing figures the advertisers desire.Though celebrities and sportsmen and sportswomen often make very large sums of money, it can also be seen as unfair to say that they do not deserve it or propose their money be used for something else. While it is true that they did not find a cure for cancer or made a life-changing scientific discovery, their hard work and expertise created a product that the public wants to see and the high payment merely reflects their value.In conclusion, it is clear that today’s society is indeed a society obsessed with being entertained and the high salaries paid to those who entertain society clearly reflect this. The high payments, however, are not necessarily out of place or undeserved.",,,,,,9.0,"There is widespread debate over whether the extremely high salaries of professional athletes and entertainers are justified, but I believe that these earnings accurately mirror our society’s prioritization of entertainment. In today’s world, individuals across age groups and demographics spend countless hours watching sports events, movies, and television shows. These forms of leisure have become integral to modern life, heavily influencing how people relax and socialise. As a result, the demand for celebrity appearances and performances continues to soar, driving up earnings for those at the top of their fields. Critics frequently argue that it is unfair for sports stars to earn more in a single match than many essential workers, such as teachers or nurses, do in a year. While this perspective is understandable, it overlooks the fact that massive revenues are generated through ticket sales, broadcast rights, and global marketing deals, with superstars acting as the crucial draw for fans and sponsors. For instance, popular football players or actors can single-handedly boost ratings and merchandise sales, resulting in substantial profits for entertainment companies. In this context, their salaries are a reflection of the wealth they help generate. At the same time, it is important to recognize the immense pressure and short career spans faced by such professionals, which can partially justify these large payments. Ultimately, the huge sums paid to athletes and entertainers are a direct result of public demand and the business structures that drive the entertainment industry, highlighting our society’s deep reliance on being amused and excited by spectacles. While some might wish for a more balanced approach to wages across professions, as long as entertainment maintains its central role, high salaries for leading sportsmen, sportswomen and entertainers will likely remain the norm."
1309,2,"Some people today believe that it is acceptable to use physical force to discipline children, but others feel it is completely unacceptable.Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","Punishing children with physical force, or corporal punishment as it is also called, is something that was accepted not so long ago and people over the age of forty may well remember it. Nowadays, however, corporal punishment is against the law in most countries and adults who practise it can be taken to court. Children are always a vulnerable group and they depend on adults for protection and education. Of course, part of the growing up process is testing and breaking boundaries and it is nearly always necessary to instill discipline on a child. Whether or not it is necessary to use physical force to do so can be a very emotive subject.Supporters of corporal punishment often defend their standpoint by explaining that the corporal punishment is not, or should not be, excessive. They do not argue that a child should be beaten severely until he or she is bruised or cut. They argue that just the infliction of mild pain causes effective discipline and also the fear that it might be applied. People who grew up experiencing it might offer this point of view.Those who oppose using physical force on a child would say that the vulnerability and innocence of a child means that force should never be used. Children need to trust adults and believe that no harm will come to them. Additionally, children learn from adults and it is argued that corporal punishment will only teach children that force is an answer to various problems. It is also claimed that corporal punishment has no added benefits over other forms of discipline that do not require physical force. Using it can cause psychological harm to children and should be classed as child abuse.Personally, I do not believe that limited use of forms of corporal punishment can cause harm, and a parent who administers a mild form of it to his or her child should not be subject to criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, I would not use it myself. I can also recognise the possibilities of adults who are not a child’s parents misusing corporal punishment. Therefore, I believe that on balance physical force to discipline children should not be permitted.",,,,,,9.0,"The issue of using physical force as a means of disciplining children is highly controversial and provokes strong feelings on both sides. Some people maintain that a small amount of physical punishment, such as a light smack, can be effective in teaching children right from wrong and stopping bad behavior instantly. They often argue that previous generations who experienced this kind of discipline grew up to be responsible and well-mannered adults. On the other hand, an increasing number of people believe that any form of physical force, regardless of severity, is unacceptable because it can cause lasting emotional harm and potentially teach children to use violence to solve problems. For instance, psychologists often suggest that physical punishment can damage the fragile trust between child and caregiver and reduce a child's self-esteem. Moreover, studies have indicated that children who are physically punished are more likely to exhibit aggression or anxiety. In my opinion, physical force should not be used on children under any circumstances. Discipline is unquestionably important, but it should be achieved through understanding and communication, not force. There are numerous positive and constructive ways to guide children's behavior, such as time-outs, loss of privileges, or explaining the consequences of actions. In my experience, children respond better in the long run to consistent, non-violent discipline. Allowing physical force only opens the door to abuse and misunderstandings that can have negative effects on a child’s development. Ultimately, I believe society should prioritize children’s well-being by rejecting physical punishment and promoting safer, more effective methods of discipline."
1310,2,"Tourism today creates a variety of problems, such as pollution due to flights, transport and dirty water.Do you think that governments should impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation to restrict today’s tourism industry?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","Travelling today is simple to the extent that within twelve hours one can travel from Europe to Singapore, crossing nearly the whole globe. Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary people’s lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families. Stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life.In conclusion, while tourism impacts the environment significantly, simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure. It could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution, instead making people stay close to home.",,,,,,9.0,"It is undeniable that tourism has become a major contributor to environmental problems, with air travel, transportation, and increased water consumption all playing a role in pollution. Some people propose that governments should impose additional taxes on flights and accommodation, making travel less affordable and thus reducing the negative impacts caused by large numbers of tourists. While higher costs might discourage some from traveling far, there are several important factors to consider before implementing such taxes. First, tourism is a crucial economic sector for many countries, providing jobs and supporting local businesses. Sudden tax increases could hurt workers and economies that depend on visitors. For example, many island nations in the Caribbean or Southeast Asia rely heavily on tourism income. Moreover, extra taxes on transportation might not only reduce tourism but also impact people who need to travel for family or work, making travel less accessible to those from lower-income backgrounds. Instead of restricting tourism purely through increased costs, governments could invest in sustainable transport solutions, promote eco-friendly accommodations, and educate travelers about responsible behaviors. In my own experience, programs that encourage tourists to offset their carbon emissions or support local conservation efforts have had positive results. To conclude, although the environmental impact of tourism should not be ignored, imposing taxes might be too harsh and could have unintended economic and social consequences. A better approach may be to focus on education, improved technology, and incentives for sustainable travel."
1311,2,Providing a national system in a country where the unemployed receive a regular payment only encourages people not to seek work and puts an unreasonable strain on a country’s financial resources.Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.,"In modern day society, money is a driving force for nearly everyone. Most people aspire to be financially secure and to have the ability to live the life they want. However, not everyone is able to find paid employment, and for that reason in some countries around the world, governments have initiated a system where the unemployed receive a regular payment to enable them to survive. Some people believe it is an excellent idea, whilst others believe that it is exhausting a country’s financial resources.When looking at the positive aspects of this system, it can be said that it prevents individuals from having a private bankruptcy. When somebody becomes unemployed, he or she will have on-going costs such as rent for a dwelling, bills for water, telephone and electricity as well as the cost of food and several other things. Without a salary, this person will fall into debt, because they will be unable to cover these expenses. A national unemployment payment system will therefore prevent this person from losing nearly everything over time. Without such system, many people would become homeless and would potentially engage in criminal activities to survive. Therefore, one can say that this system is positive. Although stories are heard of people exploiting the system, usually the newly unemployed want to find a job fast in order to become financially independent again, meaning that the government does not have to support them for long.Although there are positive aspects of this system, one can also say that if the payment made by the government is too high, it will prevent people from looking for work actively. Occasionally, the payment people receive is higher than their potential salaries, deterring them from working and creating an on-going cost for the government. A potential solution for this could be providing free training and employment support to open up new career opportunities with higher income, which would motivate this group to re-enter the workforce.In conclusion, the unemployment benefits system has positive and negative aspects. Personally, I believe that the positive effects of the system outweigh the negative. The payment must remain on a level that helps people survive without regular salaries, but does not seem attractive to exploit over a longer period of time.",,,,,,9.0,"The question of whether a national system providing regular payments to unemployed individuals encourages idleness and burdens a country's financial resources is a subject of ongoing debate. On the one hand, critics suggest that offering unemployment benefits may decrease the motivation for job-seeking, as some individuals might prefer to rely on government support instead of pursuing employment. This could lead to increased long-term unemployment rates, which, in turn, place a heavy demand on a country’s budget and may ultimately require higher taxes or reductions in spending for other essential services. However, it is important to recognize the crucial social safety net that such a system provides, particularly in times of economic downturn or structural changes in the job market. Without adequate support, people facing sudden job loss may quickly fall into poverty, lose their homes, and struggle to provide for their families, resulting in negative consequences not only for individuals but for society as a whole. Moreover, research and real-world examples from countries like Germany and Sweden indicate that most job-seekers use these payments as temporary assistance, allowing them to continue searching for work without the immediate pressure of financial ruin. To address concerns about dependency, governments can design benefit systems that encourage active job searches, such as requiring regular proof of application efforts or offering additional training and job-placement services. In my opinion, while careful management is needed to avoid abuse and unsustainable costs, the existence of unemployment benefits is an essential element of a fair and humane society, supporting citizens in vulnerable times while also maintaining overall economic stability."
1312,2,"With the increase in computer use, many people feel that schools do not need to put the emphasis that they used to on basic handwriting skills or mental mathematics skills.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","In recent years, computer use around the world has increased drastically. As a result technological equipment is used increasingly in schools around the world. Many people question therefore whether schools should put much emphasis on teaching students basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics skills.The use of technological equipment in lessons has increased since the onset of the digital age. Nearly all professions around the world involve computer use and even the simplest tasks are carried out via electronic equipment. Hence, it is important for students to learn how to use technology correctly for their future careers. Electronic devices also offer various learning advantages, as notes and assignments can be completed much faster and more neatly using these tools.Nonetheless, the practical skills such as using and holding a pen correctly are likewise vital for future careers. For that reason, students have to be taught at early ages how to carry out simple tasks using basic skills, such as writing. It is also essential that a student develops neat handwriting, as in the case of a technological problem the student will have to write by hand. Furthermore, final exams are typically written by hand and thus the student must develop the basic skill of holding a pen and writing with it. Mathematics skills are no different. People will not always have a device with them to carry out calculations and the ability to do arithmetic in the head is a vital skill for operating in today’s world.In conclusion, I personally believe that schools should keep a balance between using practical skills and using electronic equipment to carry out certain tasks by having student submit assignments created electronically, yet also by having them complete assignments by hand in class and without computers or calculators. This balance is important, as if the focus lies only on one of the two aspects, the student will face problems later on in life.",,,,,,9.0,"As technology becomes more deeply woven into daily life, it is understandable that some believe schools should reduce their emphasis on handwriting and mental arithmetic, given how computers and calculators can perform these tasks faster and more efficiently. There is no doubt that technological fluency is critical for future employment, and digital tools provide convenience and increased productivity in both academic and professional settings. For example, typed documents are usually easier to edit and share, and complex calculations can be completed instantly using computers. However, I strongly feel that the value of handwriting and mental math should not be underestimated. Firstly, learning to write legibly and quickly by hand is a fundamental skill that students still need for taking exams, making spontaneous notes, and when technology fails or is unavailable. Moreover, studies have shown that writing by hand benefits memory and comprehension, which can lead to deeper learning compared to typing. Similarly, being able to perform arithmetic mentally fosters stronger problem-solving abilities and numerical intuition, which can be crucial in everyday situations such as shopping, budgeting, or measuring ingredients while cooking, when a calculator may not be on hand. While technological advancement has made many manual tasks easier, relying exclusively on devices could leave students unprepared when such tools are inaccessible. Therefore, I believe schools should continue to prioritize developing basic handwriting and mental mathematics skills alongside digital literacy, so that students can adapt to any circumstance they may face in the future."
1313,2,"There are many things that can motivate people to perform well in their work. These can include the salary, job satisfaction or the chance to help others. What do you feel is the best motivation to do well at work?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.","To perform well in a job, people have to be motivated. There are multiple strategies for employers to incentivise their employees. The most obvious one is the salary; however, job satisfaction and the ability to help people are other methods of improving performance at work.For the majority of the people, receiving their salary at the end of the month is their motivation. This is because money is necessary to fulfill the most basic needs and other materialistic desires. Employees see these opportunities when receiving their salary and therefore work to achieve money. Furthermore, performing well in a job can often lead to promotions with higher pay packages. To receive this, staff have to stand out positively in their jobs. Salary is therefore a key motivational tool for many workforce participants.However, money is far from being the only incentive. Another aspect affecting performance is job satisfaction. If a person is comfortable in their work, they are more likely to perform well. Therefore this motivational tool interlinks with salary, as when people are content and perform well, the chances of promotion increase. For some individuals though, only their passion can drive them. Prime examples for this are humanitarian jobs. The salaries are often not very high, but those choosing to work in this field are often very driven; their passion to help others is prioritised over their own salary.In conclusion, while income might be the most common motivational factor, it is unusual to be the sole incentive for working hard, and some people are motivated wholly due to other reasons.",,,,,,9.0,"There are several factors that drive individuals to excel in their professions, and the significance of each can vary depending on personal values and life situations. While salary is clearly an important motivator, providing the means to support one’s self and family, it is not always sufficient to ensure consistently strong performance. In my opinion, job satisfaction stands out as the most effective motivation to perform well at work. When employees genuinely enjoy their tasks, find meaning in their contributions, or feel respected and valued by colleagues, they are more likely to go above and beyond basic expectations. For example, I have a friend who chose to remain at a non-profit organization despite modest pay because she felt fulfilled by her ability to make a positive impact. Her enthusiasm translated into creative ideas and diligent effort, which benefited both her personally and the organization as a whole. On the other hand, I have observed individuals in high-paying roles who lack passion, which often results in minimal engagement or even frequent job changes. While helping others can also be a powerful motivator, particularly for those in care-oriented professions, it is the overall sense of fulfillment and purpose derived from job satisfaction that best sustains high performance over time. Ultimately, though financial stability and altruism are important, the intrinsic reward of enjoying and valuing one’s work is what I believe most effectively inspires people to excel in their careers."
1314,2,"Public health is becoming an urgent issue nowadays. Some argue that governments should create nutrition and food choice laws to improve public health, while others believe that it is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Public health has become an increasingly pressing issue in the modern world, with many populations facing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases. This has led to a debate as to whether governments should establish nutrition and food choice laws for the betterment of public health or if it solely falls on individuals to make wise choices. In my view, everyone should take ownership of their diet and assume responsibility for their health because it is the right choice.The argument for government-imposed nutrition and food choice laws is that they could help prevent people from making unhealthy choices which could lead to more serious illnesses down the line. For example, government regulations could limit the amount of sugar or fats allowed in food products, especially those marketed to children, and impose taxes on unhealthy snacks like chips and candy bars. This approach would also benefit those who lack the knowledge about healthy food, necessary to make informed decisions. By providing clear guidelines on what foods are healthy, and by taxing the unhealthy options higher, the government would steer individuals away from unhealthy options.However, there are also some valid arguments against governmental intervention. These types of regulations infringe upon individuals’ right to choose what they put in their bodies. After all, everyone should be free to make lifestyle choices for themselves. Additionally, there may not be enough evidence to suggest that overly restrictive regulations would have beneficial effects on public health outcomes in the long run. Since people’s love of unhealthy food is often considered an addiction, it is unlikely that a higher price or other warnings would be enough to deter individuals from purchasing unhealthy food items.In conclusion, while there can certainly be benefits associated with implementing nutrition and food choice laws at a governmental level, ultimately it should still come down to personal choice and responsibility as far as one’s diet is concerned. Governments should instead focus on providing citizens with better nutrition education, so that they can make better informed decisions about what they consume. This way, they can receive the information they need while still having autonomy over their own diets and lifestyles.","The writer presented ideas and examples that are relevant and directly related to the topic. All parts of the question have been addressed and the arguments – sufficiently supported. The ideas have been presented in a logical way, with the writer’s opinion in the introduction paragraph, followed by the discussion of the two views and a conclusion. The paragraphs have been used correctly, each containing a well-developed idea. This essay has plenty of uncommon lexical items (terms related to this particular topic) which have been used appropriately and spelled correctly. There is a variety of complex sentence structures, the writer has good control of punctuation, and the majority of their sentences are error-free. This essay is likely to get Band 8 – 8.5 in IELTS.",,,,,8.0,"Public health concerns have surged in recent times as diseases linked to poor nutrition continue to strain healthcare systems, sparking debate over the best way to address this growing crisis. On one hand, some argue that governments should introduce regulations controlling what foods are available, such as restricting junk food advertising or mandating clearer labeling on packaged products, to guide citizens towards healthier choices and reduce the burden of diet-related illnesses. These proponents contend that not everyone has equal access to nutritional education or the ability to navigate complex food environments, so government intervention is justified to protect public well-being. Conversely, others maintain that eating habits are a personal matter, and that individuals must take responsibility for their own health by making informed choices about what to eat. They claim that laws limiting food choices may infringe on personal freedoms and can even backfire by increasing the appeal of restricted items. While I acknowledge the necessity of government action in circumstances where public health is at immediate risk, I believe that long-term improvements are more likely when individuals are empowered with reliable information and resources rather than strict regulations. Thus, education and awareness campaigns, rather than restrictive laws, should be the main strategy for promoting healthier eating habits, as they respect personal autonomy while still addressing the critical issue of public health."
1315,2,More and more people today are drinking sugar-based drinks. Why is this happening? What measures can be taken to reverse this trend?,"An alarming number of people today consume sugar-based drinks, whether it is in the form of soda, energy drinks or fruit drinks. Often consumers are lured by their widespread availability and convenience, however, marketing campaigns also play a role, targeting young people and giving them the perception that sugary drinks are not as unhealthy as they actually are.The availability of these types of drinks has greatly increased over time. They can now be found in almost any store or restaurant, which makes them easily accessible to almost anyone. The fact that they are often cheaper than alternatives, such as water or freshly squeezed juice, makes them an especially attractive option for those on a budget. Marketing campaigns for sugary beverages have been quite successful in creating positive associations attached to these products through advertisements on TV and billboards. This encourages people to consider them fun rather than unhealthy and normalises them within society.Luckily, reversing the rise in popularity of sugary drinks is still possible, if we act now and attack the problem from different angles. One of the very first steps should be educating people on the health risks associated with high sugar intake so that they can make better-informed decisions when selecting what type of beverage they consume. Companies should also be held accountable by law for their misleading marketing campaigns aimed at children and teenagers who are more likely to believe the false claims about their products’ health benefits without fully understanding what’s being sold to them. Schools, colleges and universities, and any institutions catering for young people, should consider banning sugary drinks and replacing them with refreshing alternatives without added sugar.Overall, it is important that we recognise the potential health risks posed by consuming too much sugar from soft drinks and take actionable steps towards reversing this trend in order to ensure our long-term wellbeing. Through greater education, government regulation, and increased corporate responsibility we can ensure that more people understand why reducing their intake of sugary beverages is important while still allowing them to access enjoyable yet healthier options.",,,,,,8.0,"The growing trend of people drinking sugar-based beverages is a cause for concern, and several factors contribute to its popularity. One major reason is the way these drinks are promoted and displayed everywhere, from vending machines in schools to fast food menus and grocery store shelves. Advertisements that show famous athletes or celebrities enjoying a soda can be very persuasive, especially to children and teenagers who look up to them. Additionally, sugar-based drinks often come in attractive packaging and offer sweet flavors that appeal to people of all ages, making them difficult to resist. There is also a social component; having a cold soda with friends or at parties can seem like the normal or fun thing to do. To address this issue, governments and schools must play a proactive role. Strict regulations should be put in place to limit advertisements for sugary drinks, particularly those aimed at young people. Schools should replace vending machines stocked with sugary sodas with those containing water or healthy alternatives. Public health campaigns are also essential to teach people about the risks involved in consuming too much sugar, such as obesity and diabetes. Finally, introducing taxes on sugar-based drinks could make them less affordable, encouraging people to choose healthier options. By combining education, policy changes, and awareness, this concerning trend can be turned around and lead to better choices for everyone’s health."
1316,2,"Nowadays many teenagers have a celebrity who they follow as a role model. Some people think this is not a good idea, because celebrities often set a bad example. Do you agree or disagree?","It is not uncommon for teenagers to worship celebrities. From singers to actors, many young people around the world look up to these stars and attempt to emulate their lifestyles. In my opinion, allowing children to idolize celebrities can often be detrimental, as they frequently set a poor example.Many of today’s celebrities tend to lack moral values, and they promote behaviour inappropriate for young people. For instance, some music videos feature explicit lyrics glorifying drug use and violence. In addition, the media often reports on celebrities who indulge in excessive partying or drinking alcohol despite being underage. These types of headlines can have a negative influence on impressionable teens who might falsely believe that they should follow suit to appear cool or successful.Poor morals aren’t the only issue, as many popular stars are also well-known for their irresponsible spending habits. They routinely splurge on luxury items such as designer clothing or expensive cars without any consideration for budgeting or saving money responsibly. This kind of behaviour is dangerous because it is normalizing materialism and teaching teens that costly possessions will bring them happiness instead of focusing on what really matters in life: meaningful relationships, knowledge, and hard work.To conclude, young adults should keep in mind that society’s perception of fame and fortune is based on temporary, insubstantial things rather than what actually matters. In the grand scheme of things, it would be far more beneficial for teenagers to spend time developing their own set of values rooted in quality education and strong family relationships.",,,,,,8.0,"In recent years, it has become increasingly common for teenagers to admire and follow celebrities, treating them as role models. While some people argue that this trend is harmless or even inspiring, I believe that it can actually have negative consequences, mainly because many celebrities fail to provide positive examples for young people. Firstly, a significant number of celebrities achieve fame through controversial behavior or for reasons unrelated to good character, such as reality TV scandals or viral social media stunts. This can send the message that it is acceptable to seek attention at any cost, rather than striving for genuine accomplishments. Moreover, celebrities often live lives of extravagance, showcasing expensive clothes, gadgets, and trips online, which can encourage materialistic attitudes among teens who may feel pressured to live up to unrealistic standards. Furthermore, the personal lives of some celebrities are frequently marked by unstable relationships, legal issues, or unhealthy habits, behaviors that should not be encouraged in impressionable youth. While there are a few celebrities who do set positive examples through charity work or perseverance, they are often overshadowed by those who prioritize fame and wealth over integrity. In conclusion, I feel that teenagers should be cautious when choosing whom to look up to, and that families and educators need to help young people understand the importance of following role models who demonstrate genuine values and responsible behavior, rather than simply chasing after popularity or fortune."
1317,2,Many people try to achieve a work-life balance but fail. Why is this happening? What can be done to help people overcome this problem?,"Many people strive to achieve a work-life balance, but often find themselves failing despite their best efforts. This is not surprising, as balancing work and life commitments can be extremely difficult due to both having their unique stressors.One of the major reasons why so many people struggle to achieve harmony between their personal and professional lives is that now it is easier than ever for people to stay connected outside of regular work hours. This has led to an expectation that employees should always be available, and they risk being seen as unreliable or uncommitted if they are not. A knock-on effect of longer working hours is that little time is left for leisure activities such as socialising or engaging in hobbies or sports, which help reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being. This type of pressure and lack of free time can lead to feelings of burnout, with no respite from life’s pressures, resulting in chronic fatigue and diminished motivation over time.Helping those struggling to find a suitable work-life balance will require joint efforts of managers and employees. Workers, for instance, need to recognise the importance of taking regular breaks throughout the day and getting enough sleep each night, while employers should consider being more flexible when it comes to allowing staff to work remotely and offering paid vacation days. This will give employees space, both mentally and physically, enabling them to better manage their commitments without overextending themselves.In conclusion, achieving a successful work-life balance is something that many cannot quite reach due to external pressures from employers and a lack of downtime. However, these issues can be overcome, if we create realistic boundaries between our professional lives and personal goals, and make conscious decisions about how we want to spend our time.",,,,,,8.0,"Achieving a work-life balance is a goal for countless individuals, yet reaching it often proves to be more challenging than expected. One primary reason for this struggle is the blurring of boundaries between work and home life, especially with the rise of technology that allows people to check emails and complete tasks from anywhere at any time. Employers sometimes assume that staff will be on call beyond regular office hours, and this expectation can lead to feelings of guilt or failure if personal time is prioritized. Furthermore, today’s competitive job market pressures people to put in extra effort to stand out, which frequently means sacrificing evenings, weekends, or even vacation days. The resulting exhaustion and stress take a toll on well-being and relationships, creating a cycle that is hard to break. To address this issue, both personal changes and workplace reforms are necessary. Employees can benefit from setting clear boundaries, such as turning off work notifications and making time for activities unrelated to their jobs. At the same time, employers should support flexible schedules and respect time off, recognizing that happier, more balanced workers are also more productive. Ultimately, while maintaining a work-life balance is undeniably tough in the modern world, a combination of personal discipline and supportive work environments can make it more achievable for everyone."
1318,2,In many workplaces online communication has overtaken face to face meetings. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?,"In today’s ever-increasingly digital world, online communication has become the norm for many workplaces. While this development offers numerous advantages for companies such as greater flexibility and efficiency, it also brings with it certain disadvantages like miscommunication, which must be weighed against its benefits.One of the primary advantages of online communication is that it makes it easier for teams to stay in touch without having to physically convene. This is especially beneficial when individuals or groups are dispersed across vast distances. Reduced travel costs, as well as time saved from not having to travel to and from meetings, also represent meaningful savings for businesses. Additionally, online communication platforms often have a range of features designed to make collaboration more efficient, such as providing an easy way to share documents and other materials with remote team members. To illustrate, digital resources can be sent quickly and securely via email or other software services like Dropbox or Google Drive.There is a potential drawback associated with relying too heavily on online communication at work, as the lack of physical proximity between members of a team can often lead to misunderstandings due to a loss of context or nonverbal cues that would otherwise be present during face-to-face meetings. However, in my opinion, issues of this nature can be solved by using written language more carefully to avoid any confusion or miscommunication among colleagues.In conclusion, when online communication tools are used properly, they undoubtedly provide companies with greater flexibility in how their teams collaborate without sacrificing clarity of communication, quality or efficiency.",,,,,,8.0,"As workplaces embrace digital technology, online communication has largely replaced traditional face-to-face meetings, reshaping how employees interact and carry out their tasks. This shift offers clear advantages, such as allowing employees to work from different locations, thus supporting remote work scenarios and attracting talent from across the globe. Virtual meetings often save considerable time and expenses that would be spent on commuting or organizing in-person gatherings, making daily operations smoother and more efficient. Furthermore, online tools like instant messaging and video conferencing provide the flexibility to respond quickly to issues and facilitate the fast sharing of resources. However, there are notable disadvantages as well: communicating through screens can make it harder to build trust and teamwork, and messages are sometimes misunderstood because tone or body language is missing. Despite these challenges, I believe the positives outweigh the negatives, as teams can learn to use video chats or clearer writing to bridge gaps in understanding. Thus, while some personal connection may be lost, the overall gains in productivity and flexibility make online communication an advantageous development for modern workplaces."
1319,2,"Even though experts believe that walking is a great way to improve one’s health, very few people walk nowadays. Why aren’t people walking? What can be done to encourage them to walk more?","The benefits of walking are numerous, and experts recommend it as a good way to keep healthy and fit. Despite this, the number of people who walk on a daily basis is on the decline. The reasons for this are manifold, but there are also several solutions that may help people walk more.Lack of time is the most common reason people cite for not engaging in any form of physical activity. These days most people have hectic schedules that involve juggling their work and home responsibilities. As a result, they are often too exhausted or pressed for time and therefore opt for faster and more comfortable forms of transport, such as cars, bikes or public transport. Another major reason for the reduced number of pedestrians on the roads is a lack of safety. Most full-time workers are not free to walk during the day, and will skip it in the evenings or early morning hours, if they do not feel safe enough to do so.Fortunately, there are quite a few solutions to this issue. One is making walkers safe, which means the government should ensure that there are enough sidewalks and streetlights available in every suburb, so that pedestrians can walk or jog safely whenever time allows. Another useful option is to create special walking tracks and parks in neighbourhoods where people can get some much-needed exercise in the evenings. The added benefit of promoting the healthy lifestyle and walking in the community makes this solution even more attractive.To conclude, the pressures of daily life and lack of safely while walking reduce the popularity of this healthy practice. Governments can reverse this trend by creating more green spaces for people to walk in and addressing their safety concerns.",,,,,,8.0,"Although walking is widely recognized by health professionals as an effective means of improving overall health, the reality is that only a small percentage of people walk regularly these days. The decline in walking can be attributed to several important factors. Firstly, the widespread use of cars and public transportation has made walking seem unnecessary or inconvenient for many, especially for those whose daily routines involve long commutes or packed schedules. Additionally, urban environments are often not designed with pedestrians in mind; in many places, sidewalks are poorly maintained or nonexistent, and busy traffic can discourage people from venturing out on foot. Moreover, technology has also played a role, as people increasingly rely on screens for entertainment and work, leaving little incentive to walk for leisure or exercise. However, there are steps that can be taken to encourage people to walk more. City planners and local governments could invest in creating pedestrian-friendly spaces, such as dedicated walking paths, well-lit sidewalks, and safe crossings. Public campaigns highlighting the health benefits of walking and organizing community walking events may also motivate individuals to adopt this simple but effective habit. In summary, while modern lifestyles and poorly designed urban spaces have contributed to a decline in walking, thoughtful changes at both the community and individual level could help reintegrate walking into daily life."
1320,2,"In many countries, a lot of food is wasted. Why do people waste food? How can we reduce the amount of food waste?","Despite the fact that millions of people in the world go hungry every day, a surprisingly large amount of food gets wasted daily in certain parts of the world. In my opinion, the main reason for this is that people in the first-world countries tend to only buy food that is aesthetically pleasing, and fortunately, there are some ways to tackle this issue.It is shockingly sad to know that large amounts of perfectly edible food in the form of fresh produce get sent to landfills, and the main reason for this is that these foods do not meet the standards of perfection set for fruits and vegetables by consumers and grocery stores. For example, veggies and fruit that are misshapen or have a few spots on them are still good enough to eat, yet they are often left on shelves to rot in favour of something that looks less damaged. In addition, a lot of customers confuse the ‘best by’ and ‘use by’ dates, thinking that foods that have passed their ‘best by’ dates are no longer fit to eat. Another major reason for food wastage is that people often overestimate the amount of produce they require on a weekly or monthly basis, and most of it ends up getting thrown out instead of being used.There are many ways to reduce the amount of food being wasted, and I think one of the best ideas is to increase people’s awareness of just how much good food is disposed of, only because of our superficial biases as to how food should look. Raising the awareness of the staggering number of people that go hungry in third-world countries would make it harder to throw away an apple just because it is a little bruised. Also, teaching people how to better plan their monthly food requirements would help them not to overspend on food that they do not need; it would be great for the environment and their budget. The role of the government in this endeavour is indispensable as such task would be too great for any smaller organisation.To conclude, the wasting food is a serious issue that merits increased awareness from both people and the leaders of the world. It is unacceptable to discard any food when there are so many people who are starving, and hopefully our joint effort can help improve the current situation.",,,,,,8.0,"In today’s society, the problem of food waste has become increasingly urgent, especially in wealthier nations where people often throw away large quantities of edible food. One chief cause is that consumers tend to buy more food than they actually need, often influenced by attractive deals or the desire to keep their kitchens fully stocked. This frequently leads to perishable items being forgotten and eventually spoiled at the back of the fridge or pantry. In addition, a lack of understanding about expiration dates plays a significant role; many people mistakenly believe that food labeled as past its “best before” date is automatically unsafe, when it may, in fact, still be perfectly good to eat. Another factor is that restaurants and supermarkets tend to discard food that appears less visually appealing, as they believe customers will avoid purchasing blemished produce. To address these issues, education campaigns could be implemented to inform people about how to properly store food and interpret food labels, as well as encourage them to plan their shopping more carefully to avoid excess. Moreover, businesses could donate unsold but edible food to charity organizations instead of sending it to landfills. Overall, reducing food waste would not only help combat global hunger but also benefit the environment by decreasing the volume of garbage produced, so it is important for both individuals and companies to take meaningful action."
1321,2,Newspapers have a significant influence on people’s ideas and opinions. Why is this happening? Is it a positive or negative situation?,"Many people believe that newspapers play a pivotal role in shaping the way we think. There are numerous ways in which this affects our society, and I believe that this influence is mostly negative.Newspapers have long been a source of valuable information that has kept societies abreast of the latest happenings in the world. Since the average citizen has minimal knowledge about the information in expert analysis articles, well-established newspapers are powerfully poised to form public opinion through attention-grabbing images and carefully worded commentary. This leaves the reader no choice but to trust the accuracy of what they have read.Sadly, unbiased objectivity, which used to be the core idea behind journalism, seems to be a thing of the past. The arrival and spread of social media platforms has caused a gradual decline in print media subscriptions and their circulation, since readers tend to favor the internet and social media to stay informed about current affairs. This gave rise to a worrying trend of newspapers using sensationalist and controversial tactics to improve their sales. As a result, the constant barrage of bad news has led to a society that sees itself as more vulnerable and powerless than ever. To make matters worse, there are plenty of well-documented instances where newspapers have been used to spread false propaganda which is usually politically motivated.All in all, although newspapers are our lifeline to the world around us, the recent trend of publishing misinformation has had a mostly negative impact on readers. It is my hope that newspapers will go back to publishing impartial accounts of the latest news in the future.",,,,,,8.0,"It is evident that newspapers greatly affect the way people perceive events and issues in the world, and this widespread influence can be both beneficial and harmful. The reason newspapers hold such sway over public opinion is because many individuals view them as reliable sources of information, expecting that journalists have checked the facts and presented a balanced account. Trusted articles, logical arguments, and striking headlines all contribute to shaping what readers believe, often strengthening or even changing their ideas without them realizing it. However, this impact is not always positive. Newspapers sometimes prioritize sensational stories to attract more readers, leading to the spread of fear or confusion rather than clear understanding. In certain cases, biased reporting and one-sided editorials can create divisions within society, as people become more likely to adopt extreme or inflexible viewpoints. While newspapers do have the potential to educate citizens and encourage informed debate, the growing emphasis on sales and engagement can undermine the accuracy and objectivity that journalism is supposed to uphold. Therefore, although newspapers have the power to guide and inform the public, their influence is frequently negative in today’s world, highlighting the need for responsible journalism and critical reading skills."
1322,2,Some people believe that the best way to solve environmental problems is to increase the price of fuel.Do you agree or disagree?,"Raising the price of car fuel is believed by some people to be an excellent method to solve the growing number of environmental issues. However, I strongly disagree with this idea, as doing so would make life difficult for lower-income households. While making fuel more expensive wouldn’t change the habits of wealthy families, switching to fossil fuel alternatives could prove to be much more beneficial for the environment.The most compelling reason against raising the cost of fuel is that the upper classes of society will hardly be affected by rising fuel costs, as this only makes up a minor proportion of their expenditure. They will continue to use their personal vehicles as they wish without a thought for the environment or the higher fuel prices, even if their country has state-of-the-art public transportation.Those who will feel the crunch of this decision are the middle-class and lower-income households, since travelling is a major part of most people’s routine, be it to work, school or shopping. Driving is almost unavoidable in many instances; therefore, raising the price of petrol would only serve to widen the gap between the rich and poor, and serve as an inadvertent form of discrimination.Another reason why increasing the cost of fuel is far from the best way to deal with environmental pollution is that now there are much more viable alternatives. Due to the rapid advances in technology, scientists and engineers have been able to develop several alternatives to fossil fuel, such as cars powered by electricity or naturally produced biofuel. The move to adopt clean energy sources instead of fossil fuels is a much more promising alternative compared to simply making fuel more expensive.In conclusion, I believe that governments of the world should invest more time and money in finding alternatives to fossil fuels that are more environmentally friendly, rather than simply raising the cost of petrol.",,,,,,8.0,"Some people argue that increasing the price of fuel is the most effective solution to environmental problems, but I disagree with this approach for several reasons. Firstly, raising fuel prices would place a heavier burden on people who rely on their vehicles for daily necessities, particularly those in rural areas and low-income communities, while wealthier individuals would barely notice the difference. Making fuel more expensive does not ensure people can immediately switch to more sustainable transportation, especially where public transit is lacking or unreliable. Furthermore, this type of policy could cause inflation in other sectors, such as food and goods transportation, making the cost of living higher for everyone. Instead of simply making fossil fuels less affordable, governments and businesses should focus on investing in renewable energy sources and developing more accessible public transportation systems. By promoting the use of green technologies and improving alternatives, society can reduce pollution more effectively and fairly. In conclusion, while higher fuel prices might discourage some individuals from excessive use, I believe that fostering innovation and supporting cleaner options would be a much smarter and more just way to address our environmental challenges."
1323,2,"Discipline is a growing problem in modern schools. Some people think that parents should discipline their own children, while others think it should be the responsibility of the government. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","While some people argue that parents should take sole responsibility for disciplining their children, others take the view that the government should be in charge of such matters. In my opinion, the young generation should be primarily guided by their parents where rules of behavior and moral principles are concerned. However, in some instances government intervention is necessary.On one side of the argument, there are people who hold the opinion that the responsibility of disciplining a child falls squarely on parents’ shoulders, since they are their first educators, and it is their duty to equip their children with good manners and morals even before their first day at school. In addition, every family has a unique understanding of what a suitable form of discipline entails. Therefore, some parents are concerned that any form of punishment meted out at school might be too harsh. To overcome this issue, they believe that parents should be informed by the school of their child’s wrongdoing so that they could decide an appropriate consequence for their behavior at home.Unfortunately, not all parents are objective enough to make the right decisions when it comes to the upbringing of their children. Some may lack information or sound moral background to discipline their children in a meaningful way. Therefore, the state should shoulder some of the responsibility by implementing a strict set of guidelines and policies on how to discipline children at school. I believe that such policies result in children who flourish and are more likely to become productive citizens that actively contribute to a prosperous nation. Also, this would help both parents and teachers understand which punishments are suitable for minor infractions like missing an assignment or major incidents like bullying or skipping school.In conclusion, while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that the government must be actively involved in the policies related to discipline at schools as this would ensure the well-being and successful development of the youth.","The writer has addressed all parts of the task in their response.

On one hand, many people argue that discipline starts at home, and that parents, as the primary caretakers, are best suited to instill values and maintain control over their children’s behavior. This perspective emphasizes the unique relationship and understanding that parents have with their children, allowing them to guide and correct misbehavior in ways that are sensitive to their child’s personality and needs. However, there are others who feel that government involvement is necessary to standardize discipline across schools and to make sure that all children, regardless of background, receive consistent guidance about what is acceptable and what is not. Government policies, according to this view, create clear expectations and consequences, which may help prevent serious behavioral issues and ensure that schools remain safe places for learning. Personally, I believe that while the foundation of discipline should be established by parents, governments play a critical role in supporting schools with clear, fair policies and taking action when parents fail to provide adequate discipline. A balanced approach, combining parental guidance with government regulations, is most likely to foster responsible behavior among students and maintain order in schools."
1324,2,"These days, many young people are not spending their weekends and holidays doing outdoor activities such as hiking or mountaineering. Why is that happening? How can they be encouraged to spend more time in the natural environment?","Nowadays, the younger generation tends to avoid recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism. It seems that young people prefer to spend their weekends indoors, gaming or engaging in other online activities. If that is the case, by promoting sports more actively and organising sports competitions, the schools could counteract this trend.Living in the era of technology, the wide availability and variety of online entertainment are compelling young people to spend a lot of their free time indoors, using their gadgets. Numerous relatively cheap forms of amusement, such as online games, videos, audiobooks and plenty of other activities, tempt teenagers to stay at home and lead more sedentary lifestyles. A recent survey revealed that the vast majority of students would prefer spending their weekends playing computer games, rather than in the nature. That is one clear reason why our modern youth is less interested in recreational sports.To address this issue, the school management could intervene and offer a better range of outdoor sports activities and competitions, both within the school curriculum and as extra-curricular activities. For example, high schools could increase the number of weekly football, running and climbing classes, and organise competitions at the end of each term. As a result, pushed by their desire to win, students would do more walking, jogging, running and mountaineering during the school term, in preparation for the competition. This would reduce the time spent online, lessen the students’ dependence on the Internet for entertainment, and eventually boost their desire to spend more time enjoying the natural environment.To sum up, screen addiction plays a major role in young people’s avoidance of various outdoor activities. Opening up more recreational sports and offering frequent competitions on school grounds is a great way to motivate more students to spend their leisure time in the nature.","All parts of the task are sufficiently addressed in this response. The writer has developed and supported their ideas well. The use of substitution and referencing helps to maintain coherence throughout the essay (both within and between the paragraphs).

This essay is likely to get Band 8 – 8.5 in IELTS.",,,,,8.0,"In recent years, fewer young people are choosing to go outdoors for activities like hiking or mountaineering during their weekends or holidays. This trend is mainly due to the increasing appeal of digital entertainment; many teenagers and young adults would rather spend time on social media, streaming videos, or playing online games than venture into nature. The convenience and instant gratification offered by technology are much more accessible and require less effort than planning and participating in outdoor sports. Furthermore, some youths may lack access to natural areas, or might not feel confident engaging in activities they are unfamiliar with, which discourages them from spending time outside. To address this growing issue, schools and communities could organise more outdoor events, such as group hikes, nature camps, or adventure clubs that are both fun and social. By introducing programs that combine technology with outdoor experiences, like using mobile apps for nature scavenger hunts or tracking physical progress, young people might be more motivated to get involved. In conclusion, while technological distractions are currently keeping many young people indoors, providing engaging, accessible, and social opportunities can encourage them to reconnect with the natural world and enjoy its many benefits."
1325,2,"Some people think that hosting an international sporting event is beneficial for a country, while others disagree. Do the advantages of hosting a major sporting event outweigh its disadvantages?","International sporting events are well-known for attracting a high level of attention because they give many people something to look forward to. Understandably, there are advantages and disadvantages for the host country, and careful consideration is required to determine whether a nation will benefit or lose from hosting a major sports championship.Worryingly, the new infrastructure required for hosting a major sporting event often comes at the expense of local people. Their lives get disrupted by construction works and at times residents have even been evicted from their homes for stadiums to be built. Worse still, practice shows the expensive, gigantic buildings constructed for the sports event aren’t being used afterwards and fall into disrepair, leaving the country with high maintenance bills. The financial burden from hosting the Olympic Games, for example, is staggering and can run into tens of billions. Still, the question remains whether or not the pros outnumber the cons.It is hard to underestimate the amount of influence on the country’s global status and prestige that comes with becoming a home to an international sporting event. New trade opportunities appear on the horizon, as it happened for many countries that hosted the Olympic Games. There is also a welcome increase in tourism, which gives the local economy a boost, injecting billions of dollars into the national budget. Construction of new stadiums, hotels and infrastructure such as new roads and rail links creates new jobs, further improving the country’s economy. Less tangible but still important is the aspect of national pride and the feel-good factor associated with hosting an international sports event.All in all, it seems to me that an international sporting event can bring more good than harm to a country, especially if its potential dangers can be avoided or minimised. Hosting a World Championship is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a country and an immense source of pride for its citizens.","The writer provided a complete response to the task prompt and offered elaborated and convincing ideas that fully meet the task’s requirements.

The vocabulary is diverse and uncommon lexical items have been used appropriately, with almost no errors in word choice or collocation. The bulk of the sentences are error-free, and the writer has used a variety of linguistic constructions. These components work together flawlessly and make Band 8 – 8.5 very likely for this essay.",,,,,8.0,"The question of whether hosting a major international sporting event brings more advantages or disadvantages to a country is highly debated. Detractors point out that such events often come with immense expenses, requiring governments to invest large sums of money into stadiums, transportation systems, and other infrastructure, sometimes at the cost of essential public services like education and healthcare. Additionally, there are concerns about the short-lived nature of the economic boost, as well as the risk that new facilities may not be used much once the event is over, leading to wasted resources and neglected venues. On the other hand, supporters believe that hosting an event of this scale can elevate a country's reputation and promote its culture to a global audience. It may drive an influx of international tourists, providing a temporary boost to local businesses and creating job opportunities during the preparation and execution of the event. Furthermore, such occasions can foster a sense of national unity and pride among citizens who come together to support their athletes and represent their nation. In my opinion, although there are significant risks involved, the advantages typically outweigh the disadvantages, provided the country plans carefully and prioritizes the long-term use of new investments. Hosting an international sporting event can be a catalyst for positive change and global recognition if managed with foresight and responsibility."
1326,2,"People should follow the local customs and traditions, when they come to live in a new country. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The globalised world these days makes it simpler than ever before for people to relocate and start building a life in a new country. As everyone comes from their own cultural background, a question arises of whether or not people should be expected to follow the customs of their host country. I completely agree with the view that while learning about the local customs may require some time and effort, it is valuable and will aid the integration of the newcomers into society.In many cultures following the local customs means showing respect, which is an important moral value in nearly every culture. The opposite is also true: disregarding traditions is often seen as a sign of disrespect. In order to establish good neighbourly relationships and feel welcome in the new place, it is important to demonstrate the effort to become part of the community. By expressing an interest in learning traditions, new arrivals gain a chance to interact with their neighbours and colleagues, get to know them and build some connections in the new country.Another positive aspect is the enhanced feeling of belonging that people get from participating in activities others around them are doing. When a national festival is in full swing, standing on the sidelines might make people feel excluded and perhaps even homesick, whereas joining others opens up opportunities to attend special events together, go to parties, meet new people and feel part of the celebrations. In Australia, for example, Easter is a very special time of the year and some of the traditional activities include Easter egg decoration and gifting, and baking hot cross buns; sharing your designs and recipes with others is an excellent conversation starter.In conclusion, learning the customs and traditions of one’s new country doesn’t mean a loss of their own culture. On the contrary, it is an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of cultural connections and should be embraced as a positive experience.","The writer gave a thoughtful response to the task prompt, including relevant, expanded, and supported ideas that completely satisfy the requirements of the task.

These elements work together very well and make an IELTS Band 8 or 8.5 for this essay quite likely.",,,,,8.0,"Relocating to a different country can be both exciting and challenging, and one of the key considerations is how newcomers interact with the customs and traditions of their new home. I believe that adapting to local customs is crucial for successful integration, while also recognising the importance of preserving one’s own cultural heritage. Being open to learning about local traditions demonstrates respect towards the new society and signals a genuine interest in becoming part of the community. This willingness often helps to reduce misunderstandings and fosters positive relationships with neighbours and colleagues. For example, participating in national holidays, trying traditional foods, or even just greeting others in a customary way can help newcomers feel more accepted and involved in everyday life. At the same time, adapting to new customs does not require abandoning one’s own culture, but instead, it creates a space for mutual understanding and sharing. In multicultural countries like Canada, embracing both local customs and individual backgrounds enriches the community and makes everyone feel included. In conclusion, while it can be difficult at first, following the customs of the host country is a step towards building bridges and making the most of the experience abroad."
1327,2,"Many people argue that museums and art galleries should present the nation’s art, as opposed to artworks from other countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable; they exert a great deal of influence on our perception of the world. It is only reasonable to ponder whether or not these outlets of culture should concentrate their efforts on presenting the nation’s own art, and not that of other countries. In my opinion, there should be an attempt to strike a balance and put the objects of national art in the spotlight, while allowing the public to get acquainted with foreign artworks to a certain extent.If people were to only find sculptures and paintings by national artists in their local museums, that would have a number of positive effects, such as the fame the artists of that country would gain and the pride its citizens would feel for their fellow countrymen. It would promote patriotism and strengthen the image of the country in the eyes of its inhabitants. Local artists would also receive more financial assistance from the government as their works would generate a significant amount of interest, potentially resulting in further development of the local art. However, in order to evolve art needs fresh ideas, and without exposure to a wider range of creativity the world provides, the evolution of local arts may be hindered.People enjoy art because it appeals to their inner sense of beauty and triggers strong emotions, and whether the masterpiece that causes these feelings belongs to a local or foreign artist is irrelevant. Talent knows no geographical boundaries; therefore, the emphasis should be on how much joy or amazement the work of art brings, rather than on its origin. If that principle were to be followed, we would never have to choose between local and international art. Reducing our museums or galleries’ collections to local art works, in my view, would be harmful and go against the democratic nature of art.To sum up, it seems to me that a country has nothing to lose by allowing its people to admire art created elsewhere in the world. A conscious choice by the government to support local artists while hosting exhibitions from other countries could prove the most beneficial.","The writer provided a well-developed response to the topic with pertinent, expanded, and supported ideas that fully address all aspects of the task.

The uncommon lexical items have been used appropriately, with almost no flaws in word choice and collocation. The writer employs a variety of sentence forms while ensuring that most of the sentences are free of errors. The combination of these factors makes IELTS Band 8 or 8.5 very likely for this essay.",,,,,8.0,"When considering whether museums and art galleries should focus solely on national art rather than offering works from other countries, it is important to reflect on the role these institutions play in society. Museums and galleries serve not only as preservers of cultural heritage but also as gateways to new ideas and diverse forms of expression. Emphasizing the art of one’s own country certainly has its merits, as it can foster a sense of collective identity, encourage appreciation for national traditions, and support the careers of local artists. Such focus may lead people to feel proud of their heritage, and offer artists valuable recognition in their homeland. On the other hand, limiting galleries to only domestic works risks creating a narrow perspective, depriving people of the opportunity to learn about and appreciate the stories and innovations that are born in other parts of the world. Viewing art from other cultures broadens one’s understanding, ignites creativity, and promotes empathy across borders. As a person might gain much from travel and experiencing different ways of life, so too can exposure to international art stimulate intellectual curiosity and challenge people to think differently. In the end, I believe museums and art galleries should strive for a thoughtful blend of national and international artworks, highlighting the achievements of their own artists while also welcoming global voices. This approach not only strengthens cultural identity but also enriches society as a whole."
1328,2,Today’s young generation is facing many problems at school and at home. What are the problems? What can parents do to help their teenage children?,"Young people today are under a lot of pressure, which seems to come from many directions. The problems they are experiencing happen not only at school, but also at home, and it seems that without adult guidance, our young generation will continue to struggle.Teenage years have never been simple, and many would agree that the amount of challenges has only increased with the passage of time. Bullying has been a problem for quite a while, and children and adolescents would have experienced it at school in the past, but then it would stop at home. At present, however, things have been made worse by social media penetrating the supposedly safe space of our teenagers. The unfortunate behaviour of their peers can now reach them even in their bedrooms, causing them constant distress.Another issue troubling many young people is the pressure to succeed by their families. Whether at school or at home, they often feel as if they are not smart enough, which creates overwhelm and despair. Understandably, their parents are pursuing a worthy goal of ensuring their children get a great start in life; however, many teens feel that they are failing their families when they don’t live up to their expectations. This often leads to dishonest and unethical behaviour, such as cheating on tests or plagiarising other students’ work. When uncovered, these incidents have a profound effect on young people’s future careers, not to mention their emotional well-being.It is hard to underestimate the importance of parental support to navigating life as a young person. From helping teens build a positive body image and self-esteem, to handling classmates’ difficult behaviour, to guidance where study is concerned, parents can make a world of difference. Talking to their sons and daughters about matters that worry them, listening and making non-judgmental suggestions are great ways to help. Getting a professional involved where necessary and engaging with teachers, councilors and coaches is another opportunity for parents to provide assistance. Last but not least, parents can make their children better and happier people by simply giving them unconditional love.To sum up, being a young person in the modern world isn’t easy. By banding together and paying careful attention to their teens, families can help them overcome any obstacles to becoming successful adults.","The writer’s response fully covered every aspect of the task.

At school, teens encounter not only academic stress but also intense social pressures, such as the need to fit in, which has been complicated by social media’s constant presence. This digital world amplifies feelings of insecurity, as teenagers compare themselves with the often unrealistic lives shared online, sometimes leading to anxiety and low self-esteem. At home, the atmosphere is not always a safe haven from these stresses; many parents, hoping for their children’s success, inadvertently add to their worries by setting very high expectations or by overlooking the emotional support their teens require. When it comes to helping their children, parents play a crucial role in offering balance. Instead of focusing solely on achievements, they can prioritize open communication, making it clear that it is acceptable to struggle and ask for help. Encouraging healthy routines, monitoring online activities without prying, and showing genuine interest in their children’s lives can pave the way to better understanding and mutual trust. Professional support, such as counseling, can also be considered if emotional problems seem overwhelming. All in all, the challenges may be significant, but with thoughtful involvement and consistent encouragement from their families, teenagers can find the strength to navigate these difficult years with greater confidence."
1329,2,"Crime rates are likely to decline due to the advancements in technology, which will help prevent and solve crimes in an easier way. Do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays technology is advancing faster than ever and many fields are benefitting from the opportunities this trend presents. Some think that crime prevention can be one possible application of new technologies, by allowing to deter offenders or solve crimes in a faster and easier way. In my opinion, innovation in crime prevention can be a game-changer that will reduce both the number of crimes committed and the time it takes to catch those responsible for them.Not everyone is optimistic about the prospects of the use of new technologies in crime prevention, and those who subscribe to the more pessimistic view say that advanced technologies can be accessed by criminals, therefore raising the crime rates. Such tools can, indeed, cause more damage if they fall in the wrong hands; however, it would require the offenders to be highly skilled to be able to use the modern technologies. Statistically, many of them tend to have a lower level of education, and for that reason they are likely to stick to the old ways of committing crimes, whereas the minority of highly skilled criminals are unlikely to make a big difference to the crime levels.Law enforcement workforce, on the other hand, has a much better grip on modern technology. Nowadays police officers and detectives undergo special training, take regular skill update courses, and use high-tech equipment. Facial recognition and thermal imaging are just two examples of the important tools that police are already using to find and catch offenders faster. Ordinary citizens can do their part in preventing burglaries by installing sophisticated systems with sensors, CCTV video feed and various alarms to detect and deter thieves. The combined effort will, no doubt, push the crime curve down.To sum up, even though the wonders of technology are available to everyone, it seems to me that they will better assist law enforcement in solving crimes, and law-abiding citizens in protecting themselves and their property, rather than felons. This will tip the balance in favour of reduction in crime rate and make the world a safer place.","The writer fully addressed all parts of the task in their response.

It is true that some people fear that criminals will adapt just as quickly, using advanced gadgets and methods to commit more sophisticated offenses. While there is some merit to this concern, the overall trend suggests that technology will be far more advantageous for law enforcement and society as a whole. Modern policing already relies on innovative tools like surveillance cameras, DNA analysis, and predictive algorithms, all of which make it easier to detect and apprehend offenders. Moreover, technologies such as smart home security systems and GPS tracking devices empower individuals and communities to protect themselves from theft and other threats. Although some highly skilled criminals might exploit technological advances, the majority lack the necessary expertise and are more likely to be deterred by increased surveillance and rapid response. In conclusion, despite potential risks, I believe advancements in technology will lead to lower crime rates by enhancing the capabilities of both law enforcement and ordinary citizens to prevent, detect, and solve crimes efficiently."
1330,2,Some people say that all popular TV entertainment programmes should aim to educate viewers about important social issues. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is often said that all influential TV entertainment programs should be geared towards raising people’s awareness about social issues that matter. While some TV programs could be suitable for this purpose, I disagree with the view that it should be mandatory for all of them, as the decision whether to do so must take into account the nature of the TV content and the channel’s audience.There is a large group of professionals who would benefit from deepening their understanding of what is happening in the world. Stock traders and bankers, for example, must always keep track of numerous business trends on a global scale, and they would appreciate this type of information on their favourite TV shows. Young people are another suitable audience due to the fact that they enjoy learning about popular topics from TV programmes. For instance, SDGs or the Sustainable Development Goals has now become an important topic to learn for children at school. Educational TV would provide a welcome alternative to textbooks, making learning more fun.Despite the potential advantages of incorporating educational content in TV programs, it is important to remember that the purpose of entertainment TV is for people to escape reality, to take a break from their hectic lives. Being reminded about some troubling social issues would not be appreciated by those who just want to unwind after a long day at work. Another consideration is how the content is perceived by the audience, because broadcasting serious topics as part of a comedy show might lead some viewers to believe they are of lesser significance. This would make TV shows of light-hearted nature a poor choice for inclusion of content on pressing social issues.In conclusion, entertainment TV programs can be an effective form of education for some people and a great tool to spread information. However, not all of them should be used for this purpose as there are various ways people appreciate them.","The writer presented relevant ideas in this well-developed response and expressed their position clearly.

The writer has a wide range of vocabulary and is able to express ideas flexibly and precisely, while keeping most sentences error-free. Overall, this essay is worthy of Band 8",,,,,8.0,"There are those who argue that all widely watched television entertainment should strive to inform audiences about pressing social matters. While I recognize the potential for TV shows to raise awareness about important issues, I would contend that making this a universal requirement for every program would not be practical or appropriate. On one hand, incorporating educational themes into entertainment can benefit society by reaching individuals who may not normally encounter such topics. Reality shows or dramas that subtly address discrimination, environmental concerns, or mental health could spark meaningful discussions and foster empathy among viewers. Additionally, using popular platforms allows creators to connect with younger generations in an accessible and engaging manner, which might inspire positive actions within communities. On the other hand, it is essential to acknowledge that the primary purpose of many entertainment shows is to amuse and help people relax. Forcing these programs to consistently tackle weighty subjects could diminish their enjoyment factor, alienate certain audiences, and risk trivializing complex issues if not handled carefully. Furthermore, creative freedom is an important aspect of television, and imposing strict educational mandates could stifle originality and diversity in programming. In summary, while popular TV entertainment can have a significant role in improving societal understanding, I believe it should remain the choice of producers and not an obligation for every show to address social issues."
1331,2,"In many countries, young people are finding it harder and harder to find permanent jobs. Why is this happening? What can be done to improve the situation?","In this fast-moving age, with the development of education and modern technologies, people strive to have a secure job after graduating from colleges and universities. Despite their efforts, so many young adults in different parts of the world have a negative experience of finding a long-term job.It so happens that most colleges and universities focus on students’ academic performance much more than their practical skills. Unfortunately, many companies reserve permanent job opportunities for experienced applicants because there is no need to invest much in their training. Lack of practical experience in new graduates puts them at a disadvantage as far as companies are concerned. The situation is made worse by the abundance of advanced technologies that can easily replace human labor. Robots and computers work more efficiently and with higher precision than humans. That shrinks the pool of available job placements even more, as companies only need to hire highly educated and experienced staff.Fortunately, there is a number of solutions that can help inexperienced workers gain permanent employment. An obvious one is that universities could offer internships to their students, or arrange workshops in addition to classwork. This would help students to get training and experience in their respective fields. Also, the government could examine the demands of changing labor market and steer young people towards professions that will be popular in the coming years. Together with colleges and universities the government could create special awareness programs for graduates, providing them with an overview of various job offers and their benefits. This way students would be able to choose the right jobs for themselves.To sum up, lack of demand in the labour market and insufficient experience are two major reasons why many young people have trouble finding a permanent position. Helping them gain hands-on experience as part of their studies and educating them about career options early on is key to improving the employment outcome for them.","This is a well-developed response that addresses all parts of the task. The writer discussed the reasons why young adults have trouble finding permanent jobs and also offered some solutions. The information is organised well and there is clear progression throughout. The writer used a wide range of vocabulary with great flexibility and their control of grammar and punctuation is impressive. Well done, this essay is worthy of Band 8.",,,,,8.0,"In recent years, the challenge of securing stable, long-term employment has become increasingly common among young people globally. One significant reason for this problem is the rapid transformation of industries due to technological innovations, which often leads to the automation of routine jobs and thus decreases the number of entry-level roles available. Additionally, many educational institutions emphasize theory over practice, leaving graduates unprepared for the specific skills and experience that employers expect. Furthermore, economic instability in some countries causes companies to hire fewer full-time staff and rely more on temporary or contract workers. Addressing this issue requires a multi-faceted approach. Firstly, schools and universities could adjust their curricula to place a stronger focus on vocational training and real-world experience, perhaps through partnerships with industry or internship programs. Secondly, governments can play a role by creating incentives for businesses to hire and train young workers, for instance through tax breaks or subsidies. Finally, career guidance and job placement services should be expanded to inform students about growing sectors and required qualifications. By combining these strategies, it may become easier for young people to access and maintain permanent jobs in a competitive market."
1332,2,Many countries are experiencing population growth and need to build more homes. Some say that new homes should be constructed in existing cities while others argue that new towns should be built to accommodate the growing population. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these points of view?,"In the past two decades, there has been an exponential increase in the migration of people to different cities and countries, indirectly resulting in a considerable infrastructure development. However, there has been a long-standing debate on whether to direct these infrastructure projects to current cities or establish new counties. Careful consideration of both alternatives reveals that each has its positives and negatives.One of the major advantages of focusing on current cities for new construction is that it would benefit the residents of the cities in multiple ways. Tenants living in Vancouver would prefer to buy a newly constructed house in the city where they work rather than in a new town, to reduce their commute time. Moreover, the city has everything they desire such as efficient public transport, thriving job market and affordable healthcare. This would not be possible in new towns because of the time it takes to establish services and generate opportunities for people.On the other hand, accommodating people in houses built in newly created towns would put them in a pollution-free and clean environment. This is because new towns may take at least 10 years of time to become an attractive spot for people and industries alike. As a result, their exposure to harmful emissions from industrial plants and transportation is reduced, shielding them from the risks of acquiring health complications. A recent report released by the word Health Organization (WHO) suggests that the number of people affected by airborne infections is 20% higher in cities compared to new towns that were formed just a couple of years ago.In conclusion, while there are both positive and negative aspects to these views, the decision on where to build the new homes to accommodate increasing population will depend on many other factors as well. Therefore, a thorough assessment is required before starting an infrastructure project.","The writer discussed both sides of the argument and presented relevant examples. This essay has good structure, main ideas are organized well and conveyed coherently. The writer has a good range of vocabulary and has demonstrated strong knowledge of grammar. Overall, this is a very good essay and seems worthy of Band 8",,,,,8.0,"The challenge of how to address the need for additional housing in the face of rapid population growth is a topic that many countries are grappling with today. Some people advocate for building more homes within existing urban centers, citing advantages such as the availability of established infrastructure, public services, and vibrant economic opportunities. Living close to work, schools, and healthcare facilities not only increases convenience but may also reduce traffic congestion and commute times for residents. On the contrary, expanding cities frequently results in overcrowding, increased pollution, and the strain on already overburdened utilities and green spaces. Others support the creation of entirely new towns, pointing out that these areas would allow for improved city planning, larger open spaces, and a more peaceful environment away from the noise and pollution of major cities. However, constructing new towns comes with its own drawbacks, such as the enormous costs associated with developing roads, hospitals, schools, and other amenities from scratch, not to mention the time required for these communities to become appealing and self-sustaining. Moreover, people might feel isolated due to the lack of established social networks and job markets in newly developed areas. In summary, both approaches have distinct merits and shortcomings, and the best choice often depends on a country's specific needs, resources, and long-term development goals."
1333,2,"Some think that young people should be free to choose any career they like, while others say that they should think more realistically about their future. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Choosing a future career requires careful consideration. While some people claim that adolescents should be able to pursue a career they would enjoy, others oppose to that, arguing that teenagers should aim for a high-paying job in order to secure a livelihood when they grow up. Given that our life consists of more than just physiological needs, I strongly believe that it is vital to fulfill one’s potential in the career fields that are most compatible with their interests.The youth who choose highly skilled jobs may find it easier to have a fruitful future in a materialistic sense. It is true that some professions, such as engineers or doctors, are well paid and offer more stability compared to work in other, non-professional fields. For example, psychologists usually have higher starting salaries compared to artists; they also rarely lose their jobs in recessions. People who prioritise earning a living might agree that a reliable job is a must for their future and by no means will they take risks to gain employment in a field they are passionate about, that doesn’t pay well.However, it is worth remembering that we are living in a rapidly changing world and the concept of a ‘guaranteed future’ is unrealistic. Even the smartest of us aren’t prophets and it is impossible to foresee many changes in job markets in the future; some high-salaried jobs of today may no longer exist by the time our young people become adults. Therefore, people may choose to pursue their dreams and follow career paths according to their passions and interests now, to avoid having regrets later in life.Having considered the reasons to prefer monetary remuneration over one’s interests, I am convinced that it would be a pity for youths to limit their career choices to highly paid jobs of today. Unforeseen changes in the jobs markets may affect salaries but won’t change the pleasure one derives from doing something they love.","The writer discussed both sides of the argument, expressed his/her opinion and presented relevant arguments to support it. This essay has good structure, main ideas are organized well and conveyed coherently. The writer has a good range of vocabulary, and most sentences are free from grammatical errors. Overall, this is a very good essay and seems worthy of Band 8",,,,,8.0,"When it comes to choosing a career, opinions are divided on whether young people should follow their passions or take a more practical approach. Some argue that youth should have the freedom to pick any occupation that inspires them, since job satisfaction and motivation often result from pursuing something one truly enjoys. From this perspective, a career driven by personal interest can lead to higher productivity and a happier life overall. Conversely, others maintain that teenagers ought to be realistic and select professions with stable futures and good salaries, as this secures financial independence and avoids potential hardships down the road. For instance, fields like medicine or technology are often encouraged because they typically offer more job security and higher income, unlike creative arts, which may be less dependable. Personally, I believe the ideal approach is a balance: young people should reflect on both their interests and the practical realities of the job market. While following one's heart is important, understanding the economic landscape can prevent disappointment and provide long-term security. In the end, finding a compromise between passion and practicality can help individuals build satisfying and sustainable careers."
1334,2,"In the modern world, it is possible to shop, work and communicate with people via the Internet and live without any face-to-face contact with others. Is it a positive or negative development?","The feasibility of shopping, working and communicating through the Internet is gradually eliminating the necessity of in-person encounters. I believe the merits of this opportunity outnumber its demerits and the lowered volume of traffic in addition to the possibility of long-range communication will be discussed as reasons for this claim in this essay.One chief benefit of using the Internet as a means of making purchases, working and communicating would be the lowered demand for transport, through eradicating the need for face-to-face contact. Such decreased volume of transportation would result in fewer harmful gas emissions which could significantly contribute to creating a cleaner environment. Furthermore, reduced commuting burden yields more free time for individuals. It could be spent in various ways such as working, studying and socialising with family and friends to name a few, which would be more productive and enjoyable.Another key merit of using the Internet would be the emergence of state-of-the-art telecommunication applications. These technologies have made it possible for those with access to the Internet to get in touch and send and receive audiovisual content by pushing just a few buttons. This presents a stark contrast to the situation only a few decades ago, when long-distance communication was possible solely through paper-based letters, which could possibly take months to reach the recipient.There are, however, some drawbacks to online communication, in particular the possibility that the lack of contact brought by technological advancements could potentially weaken human bonds. Taking into consideration that humans are sociable species, this could pose a dire threat to our mental health. This predicament, however, would be mitigated by the extra free time technological developments create for us. This free time could be spent with friends and family and in the long run would strengthen our relationships and improve our emotional wellbeing.To recapitulate, the Internet’s demolishing the need for person-to-person contact brings about numerous benefits. A more sustainable environment as well as more free time generated for individuals, a reduced need to commute in addition to the feasibility of conducting long-distance communication in the easiest way possible, are all instances of the above-mentioned merits.","The candidate displays a clear understanding of the task. The ideas are organized logically by following a clear progression in most parts. The range of vocabulary is wide and precise, and most sentences are free from grammatical errors. Overall, this is a very good essay and seems worthy of Band 8 or 8.5.",,,,,8.0,"The increasing possibility of conducting daily activities such as shopping, working, and socializing solely through the Internet has sparked much debate about its overall consequences for society. In my opinion, this development is mostly positive, and my view is founded upon the environmental advantages and enhanced access to opportunities that internet-based living provides. To begin with, removing the necessity for commuting to physical locations not only saves individuals valuable time but also plays a crucial role in reducing pollution and traffic congestion in urban areas. The reduction in energy consumption and vehicle emissions directly contributes to protecting natural resources and improving air quality. Moreover, the ability to work and interact online allows people from rural areas or those with mobility challenges to participate in the workforce and access essential goods and services, narrowing social and economic divides that would otherwise persist. Although some critics suggest that virtual interactions cannot replace the psychological benefits of face-to-face communication and may lead to isolation, these effects can be addressed if individuals allocate their additional free time to nurturing personal relationships and engaging in community activities. To sum up, while the shift toward internet-dependent lifestyles may entail certain social hurdles, the benefits of convenience, inclusivity, and environmental sustainability far exceed the potential drawbacks, making it a decidedly positive trend in today’s world."
1335,2,"Some people believe that excessive use of modern technologies, such as computers and smartphones, is negatively affecting the reading and writing skills of our young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Parents and teachers in many countries are feeling increasingly concerned about the effect of digital devices on vital skills of school-aged children. They are alarmed by the declining ability of young people to read and write and its suspected link to the influence of modern technology, and I wholeheartedly share their view. This essay will outline the reasons to watch out for the consequences of widespread use of computers and mobile phones by our youngsters.Primary school is a very important period when children develop their fine motor skills, which are involved in learning to write. Time spent typing on a mobile phone or a tablet doesn’t contribute to the necessary workout of the small muscles in the hands and fingers of young people. Not only do they get less practice in writing but also fewer opportunities to train in spelling words, since the ‘autocorrect’ and ‘autocomplete’ features use the first few letters to guess the entire word, therefore making it unnecessary for the child to remember and type it correctly. Another companion of unrestrained use of mobile devices is the jargon that is often used in text messages, where words are shortened or distorted. Exposure to ‘texting’ tends to replace the correct words with abbreviations in young minds, causing their spelling accuracy to decline.Reading is another casualty of unrestricted access to smart devices. Video content can be more appealing and immersive for kids and they often are automatically drawn to it instead of books. Reading requires regular practice and needs to become a habit in order to fully develop as a skill; however, it is being perceived as a boring and labourious activity by many youngsters compared to effortless video-watching. Easy and instant access to videos and movies pushes books further down the list of preferences of young audience, and it takes a significant commitment from parents and teachers to ensure that children continue to read books.To sum up, modern technology can be a friend or a foe for young children, depending on the choices adults in their lives make, regulating the amount of screen time and its purpose. Without due care the writing and reading abilities of kids can be harmed by other, more enjoyable activities they can use the devices for.",,,,,,8.0,"There is ongoing debate about whether the widespread use of modern technologies is detrimental to the reading and writing abilities of the younger generation, and I largely agree that it is having an adverse effect. Firstly, computers and smartphones offer many distractions that can prevent young people from practicing traditional literacy skills. Instead of reading long texts, many opt for short social media posts or instant messages, which rarely require proper grammar or spelling. Moreover, autocorrect features and predictive text can cause students to become overly reliant on technology, reducing their need to remember correct spellings and grammar rules. Additionally, the popularity of images and videos on digital platforms often means that visual content replaces reading altogether, leaving less time and incentive for young people to engage with written language. At the same time, writing by hand is increasingly rare, with typing becoming the norm, which further reduces spelling and vocabulary practice. While technology undeniably provides access to a vast resource of information and learning opportunities, without proper guidance and balance, its excessive use may undermine the essential skills of reading and writing among young people. Therefore, it is crucial for parents and educators to monitor screen time and encourage regular reading and writing activities, so that youngsters can develop these foundational abilities alongside their technological know-how."
1336,2,It is believed that people who read for pleasure develop their imagination more and acquire better language skills compared to people who prefer watching television. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one’s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one’s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn’t always easy because the viewer’s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context.",,,,,,8.0,"It is often argued that reading for pleasure enhances both the imagination and language proficiency of individuals to a greater extent than watching television does, and I strongly agree with this view. When people read, they are required to picture the scenes and characters in their minds because there are no visual aids provided, which exercises their capacity for creativity. For instance, readers who enjoy science fiction or historical novels must use their own imagination to visualize unfamiliar worlds or distant eras. In contrast, television provides detailed visuals and sound, which means there is less necessity for the viewer to imagine the events or settings themselves. Besides imagination, reading also plays an important role in developing language skills. Readers encounter a wide variety of vocabulary and sentence structures, which helps them expand their linguistic knowledge in a way that is both natural and lasting. Additionally, seeing words on the page can help with spelling and grammatical understanding, something that is less likely when the language is only heard on television without being seen in written form. Therefore, reading not only allows people to build a vivid inner world but also equips them with better communication skills, whereas television mostly offers passive entertainment. For these reasons, I believe the advantages of reading go far beyond those of watching TV, as it cultivates both a richer imagination and a stronger command of language."
1337,2,"Scientists believe that the world is in danger due to environmental changes. Some people say that personal lifestyle changes should be made to reduce the damage to environment, while others think that the government should do something to help. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Environmental problems are clearly something that is often discussed in today’s world. One part of the society claims that individuals should change their habits and lifestyle to improve the ecological situation. Others, on the other hand, believe that this issue should be solved on the governmental level. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and my perspective will be offered.It is hard to deny that human kind is responsible for the current environmental situation, and it seems impossible to achieve any noticeable result in this field without the participation of vast majority of individuals. For instance, a simple lifestyle change such as introducing the separation of household rubbish can make recycling projects more convenient and efficient. Moreover, consumers can reduce their usage of plastic items and, in turn, less plastic waste will contaminate the environment.However, many people still feel that the government has more tools to prevent environmental changes. One option that the authorities have is to discourage citizens from using personal vehicles by charging high taxes and additional fees. Moreover, politicians usually have access to resources to educate people about environmental problems and promote the most important ecological projects on all levels, ranging from special courses at schools to TV shows and websites related to this topic. Furthermore, it is a key responsibility of the government to protect the environment by spending state funds on research and modern equipment. Countries where legislation protects the ecology, for example Norway, have achieved visible results and overcame most environmental problems.In conclusion, I believe that a combined approach will work best to prevent or reverse environmental changes. A contribution of every individual is just as important as the intervention from the government in order to fix existing issues and save our planet for future generations.",,,,,,8.0,"There is much debate today about how to best tackle the urgent environmental issues facing our planet. Some argue that individual actions, such as conserving water, reducing energy usage, or adopting public transport, are essential for lessening human impact on nature. These people believe that if everyone takes responsibility for their lifestyle, the cumulative effect could be substantial, like how, for example, using reusable bags instead of plastic can decrease landfill waste significantly. On the other hand, some people feel that genuine progress cannot be made without government involvement. The government has the power to create stricter environmental regulations, fund large-scale renewable energy initiatives, and enforce penalties for pollution, which individuals alone cannot achieve. Measures like banning single-use plastics or setting emission standards require authority and resources on a national scale, which only lawmakers control. In my opinion, both perspectives hold merit, but neither is sufficient on its own. Major environmental progress will depend on both informed individuals making conscious choices and decisive government policies that shape and support these changes. Only together can the widespread challenges such as climate change and resource depletion be successfully managed."
1338,2,Today children are spending much more time watching TV compared to the past. Why do you think this happens? Is this a positive or a negative change?,"A trend has emerged in the last two decades with youngsters watching more TV than ever before. One of the main reasons behind this issue is the recent advancements in technology in gaming and film industries. This tendency has both pros and cons, and will be further discussed in this essay.The latest developments in video game consoles attracted both children and adults to spend extra time watching TV, compared to the past. With interactive gaming characters and high quality graphics, children are more likely to spend long hours playing games in front of the TV. A recent survey showed that TV addiction among young people, for example, has significantly increased from 5% to 80%, which was supposedly caused by the introduction of advanced gaming consoles. This increase is also partially due to films, drama series and cartoons being easily available on pirated websites and various gaming platforms.This trend has had more negative than positive effects on young citizens. More time spent watching TV adversely affects the mental and physical wellbeing of a child. For instance, the obesity ratio among young individuals in the past 10 years has risen dramatically; this has caused further health problems such as anxiety and depression. However, TV can also be used in a positive way. It is a great source of information that can help youngsters increase their knowledge and succeed in their future careers.In conclusion, recent breakthroughs in technology are driving up the amount of time our youngsters are spending in front of their TV screens. This can do more harm than good if we don’t regulate the use of TV, but parents have the power to make TV time useful and beneficial for their children.",,,,,,8.0,"Children today devote substantially more hours to watching television compared to earlier generations, and this shift can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the growing accessibility of streaming services and an endless selection of TV programs have made it extremely convenient for young audiences to find and watch their favorite shows at any time. Additionally, many parents rely on television to keep their children occupied while they manage busy work schedules or household tasks, leading to increased screen time for kids. While television can provide educational content and entertainment, the overall impact of more screen time on children is generally negative. Excessive TV watching has been linked with reduced physical activity, which in turn can contribute to health issues such as obesity and poor posture. Furthermore, spending too much time in front of screens may limit children's social interactions and hinder the development of important communication skills. Although television holds potential as a learning tool under supervision, the surge in watching habits among children today does more harm than good. It is crucial that caregivers set boundaries and encourage alternate hobbies to maintain a healthy balance in children’s lives."
1339,2,"High-rise vs. low-rise buildings, which solution is better for a growing population?","Some cities create new housing for their growing populations by constructing a smaller number of high-rise buildings. Other cities create more of low-rise buildings. Which solution is better, in your opinion?Sample EssayRising population in urban areas leaves governments with no choice but to build more houses to meet the demand. However, when it comes to construction, there is more than one way to build new homes. Some cities prefer to construct fewer residential towers, while others build a larger number of low-rises for their residents. In this essay both options will be discussed and a viable solution will be suggested.One advantage of tall buildings is that they can accommodate a large number of people while having a small footprint. This type of construction is popular in central city areas where land is scarce and expensive. For example, in New York City high-rise buildings have significantly reduced housing problems, by as much as 55% in the last few years. As a result of this strategy, rents tend to decrease which has a further positive impact on the economies of such cities. However, tall buildings offer little or no privacy, they force certain rules and regulations upon residents, and attract higher maintenance costs.Given a chance to voice their opinion, many individuals would prefer to live in low-rise buildings or even build their own houses. This option might be more attractive for big families and for older generation people who like to have their own personal space. Accessibility is also a concern for the elderly as taking the stairs when the lifts break down may not be an option for them. In addition, one or two-story houses are easier and cheaper to maintain compared to modern apartment towers. The downside of this type of dwellings is that they occupy much more land, and since land is cheaper on city fringes, new estates tend to be built away from city centres. This increases commute time to work for their residents and negatively affects their quality of life.In conclusion, high-rise and low-rise buildings have their unique advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, high rises are more suitable for younger residents and should be built in the areas where young population is prevalent, closer to the city centre and employment opportunities. Senior citizens should have a supply of lower dwellings available in quieter locations. Such flexible approach can be a good way to address the needs of growing city’s population.",,,,,,8.0,"As urban populations continue to expand, city planners must carefully consider the most effective way to provide housing—either by building tall high-rise complexes or spreading out with more low-rise structures. High-rise buildings are often favored in densely packed city centers where land is limited and expensive; they make it possible to house thousands of residents on a relatively small piece of land. For instance, places like Tokyo and Hong Kong have used high-rise development to efficiently accommodate large populations while conserving precious urban space, helping to keep some services and amenities within easy reach. However, living in a high-rise can mean less personal space and a lack of privacy, as well as higher service and maintenance costs, and some people may find the strict rules of communal living undesirable. On the other hand, low-rise buildings and individual houses tend to be preferred by families or people seeking a quieter lifestyle, since these homes generally offer greater privacy and sometimes include yards or gardens. These buildings are less expensive to maintain and are often located on the city’s outskirts, where land is cheaper. The drawback, though, is that residents may endure long commutes and have limited access to city-center benefits, which can reduce quality of life. All things considered, I believe a balance between high-rise and low-rise housing is ideal. High-rises should be strategically built near employment hubs and transit lines for younger, working people, while low-rise housing should be available in calmer neighborhoods for families or older citizens. In this way, cities can provide for the needs of a diverse and growing population."
1340,2,« Previous,"Nowadays celebrities earn more money than politicians. What are the reasons for this? Is it a positive or negative development?Sample EssayNowadays celebrities make more money compared to people working in politics. This essay will look at the possible causes of this tendency and explain why, in my opinion, this is a negative development.There are two main reasons why celebrities generate more income than politicians. One of them is that with the advent of the Internet, there are more ways available for celebrities to earn money, such as online streaming services. For example, singing a song in a YouTube video with some advertisements enables them to easily make a few million dollars. Another cogent reason for this is the growing global concerns over excessively high remuneration for political leaders, which can easily lead to public discontent. In response to such criticism, many governments have decided to reform the reward system for lawmakers, sending their salaries on a downward trend.I personally believe that this development is relatively negative for several reasons, with the main one being the potential corruption scandals this issue can create. The enormous salary gap between celebrities and political leaders might discourage the legislators from putting in work or even motivate them to commit crimes such as money laundering. In addition, the relatively low salary for stressful jobs of governors may deter people with foresight on politics from becoming politicians. This is particularly undesirable because it would result in low level of citizens’ loyalty to their incompetent government, creating unstable society with more crime and other social problems.In conclusion, the fact that celebrities are paid more than political leaders now is caused by a wider variety of income sources available to them, and supported by the social norm that a politician should not be a profit driven professional. However, I believe this is a negative trend which may lead to more political corruption and less talented governments.",,,,,,8.0,"In many countries, advertisements that target children are becoming increasingly common and might even influence family purchasing decisions. This essay will discuss the main reasons why companies focus their advertisements on young audiences and will present my opinion regarding whether this is a positive or negative trend. One primary reason is that children are easily impressed by colorful visuals and catchy jingles, making them more likely to remember and request certain products from their parents. Additionally, advertisers know that children can exert substantial pressure on family spending, convincing parents to buy things they might otherwise ignore. However, I believe that advertising aimed at children is largely negative. Because young people are not able to critically evaluate advertising messages, they can be encouraged to develop unhealthy food preferences or materialistic attitudes, which may have long-term consequences for their health and well-being. Furthermore, constant exposure to persuasive advertising can place unnecessary financial and emotional strain on families. In conclusion, while the reasons for targeting children in advertising are clear, I think this development is mostly harmful, given its potential impacts on both children and their families."
1341,2,"Some people think that it is fine for professional athletes to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well (opinion)","Some people think that it is fine for professional sportsmen and sportswomen to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Sample EssayAlthough most professional athletes are aware of their position as role models for their fans and behave accordingly, there are sportsmen and sportswomen who behave poorly during matches and in their private life. While some people find it acceptable as long as their performance on the field is not impacted, not everyone agrees with that point of view.Those who put athletes’ performance on the field above everything else point out that competitive environment and immense pressure the sports people are under affect their behavior. They argue that athletes are entitled to privacy and their actions before and after games should not concern the general public. I find this hard to agree with, because poor behavior in sports people is incompatible with their role in public’s life and also for the reason that their actions could negatively affect their entire sports industry.The main reason why I believe athletes should behave well at all times is that their behavior is tremendously influential. Spectators respect players and many copy their actions and behavior; therefore, if top players misbehave or violate laws, some of the fans may feel compelled to follow their example and behave badly. For example, after an acclaimed baseball player was caught using drugs some years ago, the number of people who were arrested for the same crime significantly increased. This shows quite clearly why high profile players should consider their actions very carefully in order to promote a peaceful society.In addition, the behavior of athletes might affect the popularity of their sports. Some companies sponsor successful athletes who boost their brand recognition and sales of their products. Players and sports industry executives are financially compensated for endorsing products and participating in commercial advertisements. If they demonstrate poor behavior, sponsors could direct their money elsewhere, and as a result sports matches could suffer due to lack of funds. To illustrate, Sumo, a traditional Japanese sport, is held every season thanks to resources donated by companies. In a year when a Sumo player was involved in a violent crime, no matches were held, resulting in a large deficit of funds.In conclusion, I completely disagree with the opinion that top athletes are permitted to behave badly because their behavior may negatively influence the public behavior and sports industry itself.Assessor’s comment: This response addresses both sides of the argument by exploring the reasons why some people think athletes are allowed to behave poorly as long as they play well, and the reasons why others think poor behavior has no excuse. This response deserves a high score for task achievement because of that. A good range of cohesive devices is used in this essay; that and the organisation of ideas makes it easy to follow. Sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is quite rich, the author also showed good control of grammar and spelling. It is worth noting that this sample is longer than the recommended 260 – 285 words, however, this isn’t an issue provided the author can complete an essay of this length and quality in under 40 minutes. Overall this is a good example of a Band 8 essay.",,,,,,8.0,"While some individuals claim that the only thing which truly matters for professional athletes is their skill and success on the field, I believe that their conduct off the field also holds significant importance. Those who support the idea that athletes should not be held accountable for their misbehavior often argue that the immense pressure of their profession excuses certain actions, and that their private lives are not the concern of the public, as long as they meet expectations during games. However, this outlook fails to take into account the influence athletes have beyond just winning or losing. As public figures and icons, athletes naturally serve as examples for millions, especially youths who idolize them and often emulate their behavior. When a prominent player acts irresponsibly or inappropriately, it sends a message that such actions are acceptable if one is talented enough, a notion that could have negative effects on society’s values. Furthermore, the reputation of entire teams or even the sports themselves can suffer when star players are embroiled in scandals, leading sponsors and fans to lose interest and causing financial harm to athletic organizations. Not only can this deprive younger athletes of opportunities, it may also damage the spirit and enjoyment of the sport for all participants. In summary, I strongly disagree with the idea that athletic ability should excuse misbehavior; athletes must act as responsible representatives of their profession, both on and off the field, in order to preserve the positive impact of sports on society."
1342,2,"Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military, while others disagree (opinion)","Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military. Others think that women are less suitable for this kind of job. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Sample EssayIn recent years gender equality in employment has been the topic of heated debate. While some may argue that women are less suited for certain jobs such as with the police or the military, I believe that female candidates should be treated the same as their male counterparts.Those who consider women to be unsuited for some kinds of jobs including the police or the military often hold that opinion because such jobs are extremely physically demanding. As the female body has smaller muscles and less physical strength compared to male body, women may have difficulty engaging in strenuous activity which can be exhausting even for men. In military service, female soldiers are more likely to struggle while defending themselves than their male peers when they are forced to move around carrying heavy firearms in the battle, which can increase their risk of mission failure. Because of the hazards and extreme conditions they may encounter, some people advocate that women are not suitable for work in these fields.Nevertheless, I believe that female applicants should be considered for police or military placements without a gender bias, because women are more suited to certain tasks. In the police service, female officers can perform important roles on some occasions such as a body search where male officers are restricted from touching female convicts. In the military service, female nursing staff are more likely to care better for injured soldiers since maternal instinct makes them dedicated and heart-warming professionals. Furthermore, for the sake of fairness to all, job seekers should have an equal opportunity to choose their jobs freely, regardless of gender. Many women have the desire to work in the police and the military and some of them have relevant expertise and qualifications. Therefore, they should not be discriminated against in employment opportunities for these jobs.In conclusion, although some say that women are incompatible with police and military duties because of the high physical demands, I believe that they should be treated as equal to men. This is because there are certain roles with the police and the military that are more suitable for women than men, and therefore both genders should have equal employment opportunities.",,,,,,8.0,"In today's world, the issue of whether women should be considered equal to men when applying for police or military jobs is a matter of ongoing discussion. Some people argue that these professions require physical strength, endurance, and sometimes aggression, qualities which are often believed to be more common in men. They point out that the tough conditions in the military or police force, such as long hours, dangerous situations, and intense physical challenges, might put female officers at a disadvantage. However, others maintain that women are just as capable as men in these jobs and should be given the same opportunity to prove themselves. They argue that physical ability should not be the only factor considered when hiring for such positions. In fact, women can offer valuable skills, like strong communication, empathy, and negotiation abilities, that are crucial for both police work and military service. By allowing women to apply on equal terms, organizations can benefit from a wider range of talents and perspectives, leading to more innovative solutions to problems they face. In my opinion, women should definitely be treated equally to men when applying for jobs in the police or the military, as equal opportunity fosters fairness and encourages the selection of the most qualified candidates, regardless of gender."
1343,2,"In many countries young people start living on their own after high school, is this a positive or negative development?","In many countries around the world young people decide to leave their parents’ home once they finish school. They start living on their own or sharing a house with friends. Is this a positive or a negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples.Sample EssayNowadays it is becoming increasingly common for youngsters to start their independent life by moving out of their parents’ home after graduation from school. This trend has positive effects on the society and the reasons behind it will be discussed next in this essay.There are various benefits for both young people and their parents when individuals start living independently after finishing school. Young adults, in this way, have to take care of their daily needs, from house chores, cooking or cleaning to financial independence. Thus, instead of wasting time on childish activities, they are motivated to learn skills and work part-time or full-time in order to cover their living expenses. Although it might seem challenging for them to live on their own at first, it would give them valuable experience, helping them to become mature, responsible adults. Parents would also be pleased with this practice since they can enjoy their own lives by having more time for themselves. Not only would they have more financial flexibility due to independence of their children, but they also don’t have to change their habits in order to adapt to the new generation’s lifestyle. For instance, it allows many people to travel around the world, which would be impossible if their children were to stay with them after finishing high school.Admittedly, there might be some challenges involved in this way of life. In some cases and especially under the influence of new friends or housemates, youngsters might choose to get involved in dangerous activities that involve drugs or petty crimes. However, instead of keeping their children close through adulthood, parents should prepare in advance and raise their children to distinguish between right and wrong and teach them to take responsibility for their actions.In conclusion, although there might be some adverse consequences to this relatively new practice, I believe that the advantages of young people leaving family home outweigh its drawbacks, for both children and parents.",,,,,,8.0,"In recent years, it has become increasingly popular for young people in many parts of the world to move out and start living independently following their graduation from high school. Personally, I believe this trend brings more advantages than disadvantages for both the youngsters and their families. By living on their own, young adults must manage their own finances, cook their own meals, and take care of all household responsibilities, which encourages the development of important life skills such as budgeting and time management. This transition from the comfort of their family home to independent living can be challenging, but it pushes them to mature and become more self-sufficient. Furthermore, parents can also benefit since they are able to regain a sense of freedom and focus on personal interests or hobbies they might have put aside while raising children. However, it is true that living independently may expose young people to certain risks, like loneliness or poor decision-making when unsupervised. Despite these drawbacks, with proper guidance and preparation from families, young people can learn to handle these new challenges responsibly. Therefore, on balance, the trend of young people moving out after high school should be seen as a positive development, fostering both personal growth and family well-being."
1344,2,"In the past people wore their traditional clothes, but these days most people wear similar clothes, is this a positive or negative development?","In the past, people wore their traditional clothes and followed their culture. These days, most people wear similar clothes and therefore look very similar to one another. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?Sample EssayThese days, people’s perspectives on the value of clothing are changing, and individuals tend to wear similar clothing compared to people in the past who opted for their traditional clothing. I believe this tendency exerts a positive influence on the society.It is certainly true that there are some drawbacks to this tendency because it may lead to a loss of global diversity. It can be argued those who wear ordinary clothes such as T-shirts and jeans cannot feel a connection to their roots, and they are likely to neglect their culture and the contribution of their ancestors. Therefore, these people may not take pride in their region, and they might migrate to an urban location rather than contribute to the development of their community. Consequently, many ethnic minorities could suffer from depopulation and eventually disappear.However, I believe that there are more positives than negatives in people opting for similar clothes. The first explanation is that individuals can feel a sense of unity with people all over the world even though they have different religions and ways of life. This would motivate people in the world to support one another, instead of thinking that different parts of the world should deal with their own problems when natural disasters and other terrible problems occur in different nations. Furthermore, this tendency is economically profitable. Generally speaking, as ordinary clothes are automatically manufactured, they can be produced faster and more affordably than traditional clothing such as Japanese Kimono, which is hand-crafted.In conclusion, although people today tend to wear similar clothes instead of traditional ones and this trend cause several problems, I believe that the society as a whole can reap more benefits of this tendency.All parts of the task have been covered.

Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.",,,,,,8.0,"In recent years, most people around the world have begun wearing similar, modern clothing instead of their unique traditional garments, and this shift can be seen as both positive and negative. On one hand, the movement towards wearing ordinary clothes, like shirts and jeans, provides comfort, convenience, and affordability for many individuals, as these items are easily accessible and require much less effort to maintain than intricate traditional clothing. This development can also support people who travel or work in international environments, helping them feel confident and accepted in a variety of social situations. However, there are downsides to this change since it threatens cultural diversity and may weaken people’s connection to their heritage. Traditional clothing is a vital symbol of identity and history, and if it is replaced by more generic options, younger generations might lose appreciation for their roots and cultural stories. Despite this concern, I believe that the practical advantages of wearing similar clothes outweigh the disadvantages, especially in a world that is becoming increasingly interconnected. Nevertheless, it is important for communities to occasionally celebrate traditional dress, ensuring cultural heritage does not disappear entirely while enabling people to enjoy the numerous benefits of modern clothing."

Scientists argue that without animal experiments, it would be too risky to develop treatments for diseases, and many lives might be put in danger if new drugs were not properly tested beforehand. On the other hand, opponents of animal testing believe that it is an unethical practice since it subjects animals to unnecessary pain and suffering. They point out that animals are living beings with feelings and rights, and subjecting them to harsh experiments is inhumane, regardless of the potential benefits for humans. Despite the valid concerns raised by those against animal testing, I believe that it remains a necessary practice, but it should be conducted under strict regulations that minimize animal suffering as much as possible. Balancing the need for scientific advancement with compassion for animals is crucial, and efforts should be made to replace animal testing with alternative methods whenever possible."

1347,2,Some think that children should leave their family home as soon as possible while others believe they should stay for as long as they like (discuss),"Some people think that it is best to encourage children to leave their family home as soon as possible. Others believe children should stay at the family home for as long as they like. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayAlthough it is thought by some that urging young people to abandon their family home at an early age is beneficial for them, others believe that it is better if children stay with their families for longer. In my opinion, leaving family home early has many advantages for children.On the one people think that youngsters ought to leave their parents’ house so as to learn life skills at an early age. Their reasoning is that it should push young people towards independence and make them learn from life lessons rather than merely rely on their parents. For example, students who pursue tertiary study away from their home city might learn taking personal responsibility. Also, living independently will teach children a lot by presenting some difficulties, which, consequently, will add some more experience that may prove essential in their future lives.On the other hand, it is argued that children should stay with their parents for longer for several reasons. Firstly, young people need advice from adults, and no one would be better suited to that than their parents. Secondly, life can be generally harsh, for children in particular. In other words, they might or take unnecessary risks if they mix with the wrong crowd. It is commonly known that young people tend to be by unethical people. To avoid that, being under parental supervision is utterly important for children.To sum up, while people’s opinions may vary, I believe that young people should leave their family home at an early age, while parents ought to provide them with appropriate advice and keep an eye on their well-being.This essay covers the task by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of leaving the family home early in life, and the writer’s opinion has been clearly stated. The arguments for and against have been organised in paragraphs and supported by examples. Accuracy of expression needs some work (see suggested corrections underlined in blue) and in one case sentence structure needs more attention.

Those in favor of early independence claim that moving out helps young people develop important life skills, such as budgeting and problem-solving, which are essential for adult life. For instance, living alone can force children to make decisions on their own, adapt to new situations, and learn from mistakes without immediate parental help. Conversely, some believe that staying at home longer gives children more time to mature emotionally and financially, while also benefitting from their family’s emotional support and guidance. They argue that the challenges of the modern world, like high living costs, justify children remaining with parents until they are fully ready to cope alone. Personally, I think that while both approaches have valid points, encouraging young people to leave home when they are prepared can foster self-reliance and better prepare them for future challenges, provided there is continued support from their families when needed."
1348,2,"When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers (agree/disagree)","When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers for people to spend their free time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Sample EssaySome people argue that town planners should have a preference for more parks and gyms to be created than business districts and shopping malls. While I understand the concerns of people who hold this opinion, it seems to me that shopping centers are just as important as parks and gyms in a town.There are reasons why public facilities are crucial to city inhabitants. First of all, they provide suitable spaces and equipment for people to exercise. For example, people can go jogging in the park and play tennis or basketball at the sports stadium. That helps to keep their bodies fit and it also elevates their mood during the day. Besides, parks and sports facilities are good spots for people to socialize with their neighbors. People can connect with others when they are playing sports or talking casually with passers by in the park. A harmonious relationship between residents helps build a caring and friendly neighborhood.Although parks and gyms give the town dwellers all kinds of benefits, I would like to point out the importance of shopping malls to the district. Firstly, a shopping center could make shopping more convenient for the local residents. It would enable them to easily purchase things in town and transport them home with less effort and at lower cost. They would not need to spend extra money on transportation or shipping of the goods. Secondly, a shopping mall can provide employment. Locals can find work in retail, maintenance or security of the mall, hence earning an income to support their families.In conclusion, although parks and sports facilities serve as places for exercise and social activities for city dwellers, I believe that shopping centers are equally important, since they can provide job opportunities and convenience to the town residents.This essay would score well on Task Achievement because it addresses all parts of the question, discusses reasons for and against building more parks than shopping malls and expresses the opinion of the writer. The main ideas are organized well and explained coherently. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of the task response. Overall, this essay could get Band 8 in IELTS.",,,,,,8.0,"When it comes to designing new towns, prioritizing public parks and sports facilities over shopping centers is a viewpoint I support to a large extent. Parks and sporting venues offer spaces for exercise and leisure, which are essential for keeping a community healthy and reducing stress. For instance, residents with access to green areas can go for walks, play with their children, or take part in group fitness activities, all of which contribute to physical well-being and a sense of belonging. In addition, sports facilities can encourage teamwork and discipline among young people, helping them develop important social skills. On the other hand, while shopping centers do provide opportunities for commerce and employment, they do not offer the same health and environmental benefits. Shopping malls often lead to overconsumption and can increase pollution and traffic. Meanwhile, parks and sports facilities help to reduce the urban heat island effect and improve air quality. In summary, though shopping centers have their place in modern towns, building more parks and sports venues fosters a higher quality of life and long-term benefits for communities, making them a preferable option in city planning."
1349,2,Some people think that public health in a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food (agree/disagree).,"Some people think that public health within a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food. Others, however, think that health is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Personal and public health are tightly related to food choices. While some people believe that the government should regulate nutrition to improve public wellness, others argue that it should be people’s decision whether to pursue a healthy diet or not. This essay will discuss both points of view and explain why the authorities should not control the types of food people can buy.Legislators could impose laws concerning nutritious food in an effort to have a healthier population, public health costs. Even if this could be considered a good idea, it would be very quite difficult to implement. To achieve this target, the rulers could impose a levy on unhealthy food options, or reduce their availability on the grocery stores shelves. In Italy, for example, products such as carbonated sugary drinks and chips are heavily taxed. As a result, the sales of these items have decreased. However, if the authorities start to take control of what their citizens can or cannot eat, it may be seen as limitation of freedom.Since personal freedom is an extremely important human right, many people think that they should be responsible for their choices regarding the food and drinks they decide to consume. I agree with this opinion because limiting nutritional options, even if it is done with the best outcome in mind, could consequently create dissatisfaction among the population, which would possibly lead to other public issues such as protests and demonstrations. A better approach could be educating the public about a healthy diet, which would help people make better-informed decisions about the food they consume. Many developed countries around the world employed this strategy and saw public health gains.In conclusion, even though the government is able to control the dietary habits of its population through taxation and restrictions, healthier citizens and reduced public health expenses isn’t the only possible outcome. Limiting personal freedom could result in social unrest and for that reason diet decisions are better to be left up to well-informed individuals.This response achieved the task requirements by discussing whether the government or individuals should be in control of their diet. The ideas are developed and supported by examples, the information is organised in paragraphs, and coherence is maintained throughout the essay. A range of sentences structures and advanced vocabulary is used in this work. Overall, it seems worthy of IELTS Band 8+.",,,,,,8.0,"The debate about whether the government should make laws regarding nutritious food to improve public health is ongoing. Some argue that strict regulations, such as banning trans fats or requiring clearer nutritional labeling, could significantly reduce rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. For example, in countries like Denmark, where artificial trans fats have been banned, there has been a marked decrease in heart-related illnesses. This suggests that legislation can have a strong positive impact on national health. However, opponents believe that making dietary choices is a personal matter, and that people should be trusted to make decisions that are right for them. They contend that government interference in food choices could lead to resentment and decrease individual freedom. Additionally, critics often point out that education and public awareness campaigns can be equally effective without being intrusive. Personally, I believe that while education and personal responsibility are important, certain government regulations regarding nutrition are justified if they help to prevent disease and reduce healthcare costs for society as a whole. In conclusion, although personal choice is valuable, some level of government intervention may be necessary to promote the overall health of the population, especially when the consequences of poor diet impact everyone."
1350,2,"Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home, why and what are the advantages/disadvantages?","Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home. Why do you think it happens? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a choice?It is a very popular practice in the modern society to order ready-made food from restaurants, rather than cooking at home. The main reasons for such a tendency may be cheap prices in some restaurants and people’s desire to save some time . Even though ordering food some obvious advantages, its disadvantages should not be underestimated.On the one hand, ordering prepared food may be the best choice for a busy person, who does not have time for cooking and cleaning. Cooking food at home requires a considerable amount of time, moreover the cleaning process may take even more time and resources than cooking itself. For example, cooking a simple dish such as chicken with rice home requires significant amounts of water and electricity for electrical appliances such as the oven and dishwasher. Hence, having an opportunity to order food from a restaurant will save a lot of time, electricity and water.On the other hand, delegating the process of cooking to some restaurant a dramatic disadvantage of not having the information about the ingredients used in the meals. With high demand, grow the volumes of required products, which sometimes can affect the quality of purchased produce. For example, it is a very common practice in some restaurants to make salads from products that are about to go bad and mask the rotten scent by adding some chemicals and spices. Hence, some restaurants may use poor quality products or chemicals for boosting taste and preservatives, which may have a negative effect on the customer’s health in the long run.In conclusion, ordering food from restaurants may be a tempting choice for people who have no time for cooking at home, but this approach has a critical disadvantage of being not informed about the ingredients used in the meal, which can have destructive consequences.This response covers the task requirements by giving a reason why people would choose to buy ready-made food and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of this trend. The ideas are conveyed quite clearly and supported by examples, paragraphing helps to present the information in a neat and easy to follow way, and the level of coherence is adequate in this essay. A range of complex sentence forms and advanced vocabulary is used and there are very few instances of erroneous grammar or inaccurate expressions (see corrections underlined in blue). Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.",,,,,,8.0,"In recent years, a growing number of people prefer purchasing ready-made meals instead of preparing food themselves at home. This trend is primarily driven by the fast pace of modern life, where individuals often feel they do not have enough time or energy to cook after long workdays. Another important factor is convenience, as ready-made food is easily accessible and offers a wide variety of options that can be delivered quickly, catering to different tastes and dietary needs. While this habit can certainly save time and effort, it is not without its downsides. On one hand, ready-made food allows people, particularly those with demanding schedules, to focus on other essential tasks or even enjoy more leisure time, without worrying about grocery shopping or cleaning the kitchen. Additionally, some ready-made meals are relatively affordable and can provide a quick solution for unexpected guests. On the other hand, frequently consuming ready-made food can lead to health problems over time because these meals tend to contain high levels of salt, sugar, and preservatives to enhance flavor and extend shelf life. Furthermore, eating out or ordering food is generally more expensive in the long run, and it often discourages family members from spending quality time together during home-cooked meals. In conclusion, while the shift towards ready-made food is understandable given the modern lifestyle, it brings both practical benefits and significant drawbacks, especially regarding health and family relationships."
1351,2,"Nowadays that many women have full time jobs, it is logical to share the housework evenly between men and women (agree/disagree)","Nowadays in many countries women have full time jobs. Therefore, it is logical to share household tasks evenly between men and women. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Nowadays an ever-increasing number of women work full time, and in this reality it is widely believed that house chores should be shared between men and women equally. I strongly agree with this statement.One of the reasons for sharing housework between is to promote gender equality. A stereotype that has existed a long time is that females ought to stay home, taking care of the family once they got married. This includes looking after the children and doing all of the housework, which is fairly labour-intensive. However, this approach could have quite a few disadvantages. It would render women less able of keeping abreast of what is happening in the job market, thus forming a lifestyle where they might find it arduous to step into the society again. To avoid this, many women are willing to get back into the workforce soon after their maternity leave, and once they do, it makes sense that their husbands should share part of the household chores, to fulfill their family responsibilities.Nevertheless, we cannot be oblivious several drawbacks of this trend. One potential downside is that men are less experienced in dealing with household tasks. This is because many seldom take an active role in doing housework, according to customs of many countries. As a result, they may end up doing household tasks in a less than perfect way, which could contribute to some unnecessary quarrels between partners, hindering their family bond. However, the likelihood of this happening isn’t very high, because wives can offer some tips or guidance to their husbands when they learn how to share house chores such as mopping floors or doing laundry.To sum up, although some conflicts might be triggered when equally sharing the duties of household tasks, the benefits of this trend are relatively oblivious.The writer covered the task well by discussing the positives and negatives of sharing housework equally between men and women. Each paragraph has a clear purpose and assists with orderly presentation of ideas, making this essay easy to follow. The ideas are explained and substantiated, and the writer’s opinion is clear. The range of vocabulary is wide enough to avoid unnecessary repetition. Accuracy of expression could be improved (see corrections underlined in blue), but all in all this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.",,,,,,8.0,"With the increasing number of women participating in full-time employment, it is only reasonable for household duties to be shared evenly between men and women. I firmly support this idea, as it promotes fairness and acknowledges the changing dynamics in modern families. In the past, it was often assumed that women would handle all domestic work, but this traditional expectation is outdated in today’s society where both partners contribute to the family’s financial needs. Sharing housework can reduce stress for women and prevent feelings of resentment that may arise from having to manage both career and home responsibilities alone. Furthermore, dividing domestic tasks allows couples to enjoy more quality time together, strengthening their relationship and setting a positive example for their children regarding gender equality. Despite arguments that some men might struggle with household chores due to lack of experience, this can be overcome with practice and cooperation. In summary, distributing housework equally is a logical response to the evolving roles of men and women, and it benefits both individuals and the family as a whole."
1352,2,"Some believe the government should take care of retirees, while others think everyone should save for their own retirement (opinion)","Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age, including my home country where men can now retire at the age of 67 instead of 65. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development.This response addresses all parts of the topic, by discussing the merits of funding one’s own retirement versus relying on government pension. The writer’s opinion has been stated as well and is very clear. The neat presentation of ideas has been helped by appropriate paragraphing, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. The author’s vocabulary seems to be rich and there is a variety of sentence structures used in this essay. Overall, this essay deserves an IELTS Band 8.",,,,,,8.0,"In many countries, the question of who should be responsible for retirement support continues to be a topic of heated debate. While some insist that the government ought to provide for all retirees to ensure their security and dignity in later life, others argue that individuals themselves should be accountable for saving enough during their working years to cover life after retirement. I am of the view that, although safety nets provided by the government are essential for those genuinely in need, personal responsibility in retirement planning is not only practical but also beneficial for both individuals and society. When people take the initiative to save for their future, it cultivates financial discipline and independence, which can lead to greater life satisfaction. Moreover, expecting the government to support everyone after retirement places substantial strain on public resources, which could otherwise be spent on crucial sectors such as education or healthcare. For instance, in several countries where state pension systems are struggling, governments have already been forced to adjust benefits downward due to the aging population. This situation signals the need for workers to secure their futures independently as reliance on government support alone becomes less feasible. Therefore, while targeted state assistance should be ensured for those who are unable to save due to circumstances beyond their control, encouraging a culture of individual savings is vital for sustainable long-term welfare."
1353,2,Some people say that arts subjects are as essential as academic ones and should be part of school syllabus (agree/disagree),"Some people say that art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are an essential part of education, and every school should include them in its syllabus. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion and examples from your own experience.Art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are fundamentals that enrich our lives. However, some parents say schools on teaching more academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, literature and history. In my opinion, both academic and arts subjects should be taught and I will expand on the pros and cons of including arts in the school program further on in this essay.On the one hand, academic subjects are often required when we get into higher . Academic subjects may be considered as in the academic world. Personally, I have never taken an entrance exam of art subjects for high school or university. In other words, schools measured my academic abilities using academic subjects, not art subjects. To suit the current educational system, many parents in my home country, Japan, send their children to cram schools to study academic subjects deeply.On the other hand, art subjects can strengthen the creativity and flexibility of individuals. Liberal arts, which include cultural understanding and knowledge, also include other arts subjects. In addition, we are living in the era of automation and artificial intelligence which are replacing human labor and office work more and more. In this regard, human creativity becomes more important. Therefore, art subjects are being more in demand to make a difference between individuals and computers.In conclusion, academic and arts subjects should blend in a school syllabus in a balanced way. Art subjects can also a better personality in individuals, so participation in these classes should be encouraged as well as academic achievements.The writer explored the reasons why including arts subjects in school syllabus is a good idea, while fluently expressing ideas and supporting them by examples. Correct paragraphing assists with orderly presentation of information, making this essay easy to follow; the range of vocabulary is quite wide. Accuracy of expression needs a bit more attention (see corrections underlined in blue), but overall, this essay could achieve IELTS Band 8.",,,,,,8.0,"The question of whether arts subjects are as important as academic disciplines and should be part of the school curriculum is a topic of ongoing debate. While academic subjects like mathematics, science, and languages are seen as essential for higher education and future careers, I strongly believe that arts subjects deserve an equal place in the school syllabus. Art subjects, such as painting, music, and theater, play a vital role in nurturing students’ creativity, emotional intelligence, and cultural awareness. In my own experience, participating in school choir and drama classes not only improved my confidence but also helped me manage stress and form deeper connections with classmates. At the same time, focusing solely on academic subjects may limit students’ opportunities to explore their interests and develop important life skills like collaboration and critical thinking. Furthermore, as our society continues to change rapidly due to technology, the ability to innovate and think outside the box has become increasingly valuable—skills often fostered through arts education. Therefore, for a well-rounded development of students, schools should balance both arts and academic subjects, ensuring that young people are equipped for the challenges of the future while also enjoying a fulfilling education."
1354,2,"Nowadays people waste a lot of food, why is this happening and how to reduce waste?","Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?At the time when famines heavily strike impoverished third world countries, many people living in wealthy countries waste tremendous amounts of food daily. In my opinion, understanding the probable reasons of this phenomenon is important and may lead us to some applicable solutions that will result in reducing food waste.The low cost of food seems to be one of the obvious reasons, exacerbating the problem. Due to the revolutionary technological achievements, people have increased both the quality and the quantity of their crops. In turn, according to the laws of supply and demand, the prices of the crops have immensely dropped. A recent study of the FAO stated that the global crops prices have dropped 50 per cent over the last decade. This enabled people to buy excessive amounts of food without a real need.Furthermore, the absence of strict regulations to discourage or punish this attitude can also be considered a major cause. Not everyone is aware that wasting food may create problems. Consequently, they are likely to resist any calls for controlling the consumption of dietary supplies unless they are forced by the power of law. Several countries in the world saw a drop in their national food waste after implementing a ban on the excessive purchasing of food.Fortunately, there are some possible approaches that can be adopted by both people and governments. Firstly, raising the awareness of this issue is immensely important. Using social media platforms can draw public attention to the potential dangers of food waste and how communities can confront it. Secondly, enforcing laws that prohibit the wasting of food by people and companies will deter such harmful practice.In conclusion, the decreased price of food as well as lack of regulations allowed the unfortunate trend of throwing away food to continue. I believe that creating awareness and legislation are parts of a straightforward solution to this issue.The writer explored the reasons for throwing away food and suggested some solutions, effortlessly conveying his/her ideas in this well-written IELTS essay. The information is presented in an orderly, logical and coherent way. A wide range of vocabulary is used in this written response. The sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is impressive. Overall, this essay could achieve IELTS Band 8.",,,,,,8.0,"In recent years, food waste has become a significant concern around the world, particularly in developed nations where abundance is the norm. Several reasons contribute to this growing issue. One major factor is the culture of consumerism, which encourages people to purchase more than they actually need, often influenced by attractive promotions and bulk discounts. As a result, much of this surplus food ends up expiring before it can be consumed and is thrown away. Another reason is the lack of careful meal planning in busy modern lifestyles, where individuals frequently opt to dine out or order takeout, neglecting the food they already have at home. Additionally, supermarkets and restaurants contribute to the problem by discarding food that does not meet aesthetic standards or is nearing its expiration date. To tackle food wastage, both individual and collective actions are necessary. On a personal level, people can make a difference by planning their shopping, storing food properly, and using leftovers creatively. Governments and organizations can help by launching educational campaigns to inform the public about the environmental impacts of food waste and by introducing policies that encourage businesses to donate unsold yet still edible food to charities. Ultimately, a combination of increased awareness and practical measures can significantly reduce the quantity of food we waste, benefitting both society and the environment."
1355,2,"Some parents encourage young people to leave home while others think they should stay with the family, discuss and give your opinion","Many parents encourage young people to leave home when they become older, while others think they should stay at home with the family. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.With the tremendous influence of modernisation, remarkable changes have taken place in the family structure to such an extent that nowadays, youngsters are motivated by their parents to live alone as they grow up. However, some people are of the view that it is more practical for a youngster to live with their family.On the one hand, there are many positive aspects to youths living away from their parents at young age. This provides the opportunity to young people to live a life on their own terms and make any decisions without the interference of their parents. Besides, living alone not only makes them independent but also makes them self-reliant, which is a crucial life skill to their successful career. For instance, managing all the house chores such as cleaning, paying bills, cooking and so on will make them well experienced at learning and managing diverse activities and will also boost their confidence.On the other hand, there is no denying the fact that youngsters living away from their family may find themselves in circumstances that may adversely affect their life. Naïve and inexperienced young people in the absence of parental supervision are more likely to fall prey to bad influence and dangerous activities, such as drugs or alcohol consumption, which may jeopardise their career or lead them astray from moral values. However, this situation is less likely to take place with youngsters still living with their parents. Besides, emotional bonding and family relationships can be maintained better if everyone is living together under one roof.In my opinion, although encouraging youngsters to live alone may lead them to learn various life skills, negative aspects and risks associated with living alone can far outweigh the benefits.This response covers the task topic well, by discussing the positive and negative aspects of living alone as a young adult, and the writer’s opinion has also been included. Paragraphing helps to present ideas in an orderly way, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. There is some repetitive use of the word ‘make’ in the first body paragraph, which could have been avoided. Apart from that, the writer’s vocabulary seems to be quite rich and allows them to communicate ideas precisely and clearly. Overall, this essay seems to be worthy of IELTS Band 8.",,,,,,8.0,"With society evolving at a rapid pace, the question of whether young people should depart from home or remain with their families has become a major topic of discussion among parents. Proponents of young adults leaving home argue that such experiences help them develop a strong sense of responsibility and adaptability, as managing daily routines, finances, and personal challenges without family support can nurture resilience and independence. Furthermore, living away often exposes young people to diverse perspectives and cultures, broadening their horizons and preparing them for the complexities of modern life. However, there are those who maintain that staying with family offers key benefits, such as emotional security and guidance during critical years when young people are still maturing. This environment can prevent them from encountering unnecessary risks, and the support of loved ones can ease the burdens of early adulthood. Personally, I believe that while the comfort of family is valuable, encouraging young people to experience life independently, even for a short period, helps them grow into self-reliant and well-rounded individuals, provided that they remain connected to their families for emotional and moral support."
1356,2,"What are the difficulties of learning a foreign language, and how to overcome them?","Many people believe that learning a foreign language is a very difficult task. What are the most difficult things about learning a foreign language? What is the best way to overcome them? Explain and include your personal experience or knowledge of these problems.It is true that acquiring new language skills is by no means an easy task. Language learners might encounter several challenges such as unfamiliar accents or grammar structures a foreign language. However, in my opinion, such difficulties can be tackled by a well-rounded education system.When it comes to languages, it is undeniably crucial to get used to a native accent and intonation for effective communication. However, picking up an accurate accent can be enormously difficult, especially for adult learners because of their lack of language learning ability. If a language learner has an unrecognisable accent and intonation, they would not be understood by native speakers. On top of that, each language has different grammar and typical grammatical sequencing of words. For example, Korean sentences always end with verbs whilst English not, which means that a Korean English-learner should the correct order of words.Despite the aforementioned difficulties, I strongly believe that everyone can master a foreign language when a couple of feasible steps are taken. Firstly, it is more important than anything to start learning a new language at a young age. By incorporating foreign language programmes in the primary school curriculum, children can easily be exposed to languages of the world and eventually acquire language skills without difficulties. Secondly, the government can financially subsidise schools to run student exchange programmes that help adolescents to get experiences abroad and make friends overseas while improving their foreign language in a way.In conclusion, I believe that individuals can have difficulties in learning a new language because of different accents and unfamiliar grammar, however, these problems can be overcome by a good quality of education system subsidised by governments.The writer covered the task by talking about some difficult aspects of learning a new language and steps to overcome them. The ideas are presented in an orderly way, their logical sequencing and the use of paragraphing make this essay easy to follow. Skillful use of linking words and expressions helps the writer maintain coherence and cohesion. Word choice needs some more attention in this essay (see suggested corrections for expressions underlined in blue), however, overall this essay seems to be worthy of IELTS Band 8.",,,,,,8.0,"Learning a foreign language is often considered to be a daunting challenge due to several significant obstacles that learners usually encounter. One of the main difficulties is understanding and using correct pronunciation, which can vary greatly from the sounds present in a person’s native language, making it hard for learners to sound natural or be clearly understood by native speakers. Another big hurdle is grasping the grammatical rules, as every language has its own unique structure, tenses, and ways of forming sentences; for instance, in Spanish, the position of adjectives is different from English, which can confuse beginners. In addition, expanding one's vocabulary is time-consuming because many words have no direct translation, and learners must not only memorize new terms but also learn how to use them in proper context. To overcome these problems, consistent practice is essential. Engaging with the language daily—by watching movies, listening to music, or speaking with native speakers—can help with improving accent and understanding real-life usage. Furthermore, enrolling in well-organized language courses and making use of language learning applications can make studying grammar and vocabulary easier and more interactive. In my experience, joining a conversation club was very helpful in boosting my speaking confidence and refining my listening skills, as it provided a supportive environment to make mistakes and learn from them. In conclusion, although learning a foreign language involves overcoming major difficulties like pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary, these challenges can be managed through persistent effort, regular practice, and taking advantage of available educational resources."
1357,2,Should employers pay more attention to personal qualities rather than qualifications?,"While recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and include relevant examples.Recent decades have witnessed a burgeoning growth of numerous industries; therefore, recruiting the right person for the position is crucial to the development of enterprises. But how do we determine if a person is the best fit? Advocates of conventional recruitment methods opine that this candidate must have sufficient experience and qualifications needed for that job. Nevertheless, some people argue that candidates’ personal qualities cannot be ignored. In my view, both components are of equal importance.To begin with, the conventional approach of checking potential workers’ qualifications via their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, issued qualifications and certifications from authorised organisations is vital. Apparently, whenever we submit a job application, we are always required to attach a CV while a cover letter is optional. Without a decent qualification, even if that candidate’s personal characteristics are suitable, the enterprise will need to carry out lots of skill trainings eventually.On the other hand, occasionally during an interview some HR officers ignore the significance of assessing how candidates’ individual qualities can fit in the company. Employers should assess not only candidates’ qualifications but also their enabling skills, ethics and value propositions. The more an employee’s personal qualities fit in a company’s culture and values, the more he or she is motivated to contribute to that company’s vision. KPMG is a great example of evaluating candidates’ personal qualifications and skills by utilising a game-based assessment process, followed by a video interview. This methodology enables a comprehensive assessment, and is embraced by many companies nowadays.To summarise, employers should assess both personal characteristics and formal qualifications when recruiting people as each of these elements has its own vital contribution to make in talent-seeking enterprises.This response covers the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly expressed and supported by an example, the use of paragraphing makes this essay organised and easy to follow. Linking words are used appropriately. The use of complex sentences and advanced vocabulary is impressive. Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.",,,,,,8.0,"In today’s rapidly evolving job market, the question of whether employers should focus more on personal qualities than on formal qualifications has become increasingly relevant. While it is undeniable that qualifications and professional experience provide an essential foundation for any position—demonstrating the candidate’s technical aptitude and theoretical knowledge—they do not alone guarantee optimal workplace performance. Personal qualities such as adaptability, teamwork, problem-solving skills, and integrity often have a more profound impact on an employee’s long-term success within a company. For example, a project manager with impressive academic degrees but poor communication skills may struggle to efficiently lead a diverse team. Conversely, someone with average qualifications but exceptional leadership and emotional intelligence can often inspire colleagues and drive impressive results. Some companies, such as Google, have recognized this and implemented hiring processes that strongly assess both cultural fit and potential, not just credentials. Therefore, while qualifications remain crucial for shortlisting and initial assessment, personal qualities provide the flexibility and resilience needed to thrive amid constant change. In conclusion, a balanced approach that considers both aspects is key; however, in contemporary work environments where innovation and collaboration are paramount, employers should arguably place greater emphasis on personal qualities during recruitment."
1358,2,"Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems, is this a positive or negative development?","Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems. Is it a positive or negative development? Give your own opinion and examples from your experience.At present, the Internet plays a vital role in almost every aspect of human life. As a result, individuals are searching online reasonable solutions to their illnesses. Not everyone is convinced that access to such information online is safe and helpful. However, in my view, providing the general public with access to trustworthy information about medical disorders would invariably improve the quality of the medical care for the whole society.Nowadays, even though there are plenty of online platforms developed for medical education, most of the sites have not been written by professional healthcare providers. Hence, there is a high possibility of spreading wrong medical information throughout the world, unless the site developers are held accountable for the content they provide. If patients receive incorrect information about a medical procedure and follow the wrong advice, for instance, to remove a wart at home, it might lead to a serious infection, excessive bleeding or another medical emergency. That would constitute a negative effect of using online knowledge for medical treatments at home rather than visiting a professional.On the flip side, the Internet, the society is well aware of most common medical disorders and preventive measures. Consequently, a reasonable and prudent individual can decide whether to get professional opinion on one’s disease or to handle it at home, that they get reliable online medical information. Moreover, if patients can manage mild medical problems themselves, it would certainly reduce the workload at the local hospitals, freeing more doctors for patients in real need. Besides, if patients come with a certain extent of knowledge about their condition to the medical consultation, it would invariably be helpful to the medical practitioner for effective decision making.To sum up, it is evident that online search for information on medical disorders can be a positive development as long as the general public receives trustworthy information.This response addresses the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly explained and supported, the information is organised in paragraphs in an easy to follow way, and use of linking words is appropriate. A range of complex sentence forms is used and there are very few errors in word choice or word formation (underlined in blue). Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.",,,,,,8.0,"In recent years, many individuals have turned to the Internet as a primary source for answers to their health concerns. While some believe this trend empowers people and makes medical information more accessible, others worry about the negative consequences of self-diagnosis and misinformation. Personally, I think that searching for medical solutions online brings both benefits and risks, but it can be a positive development if used carefully. On one hand, the Internet offers a wealth of information on various diseases, symptoms, and treatments. This allows people to quickly educate themselves about their health, understand possible causes of their discomfort, and take preventive actions. For example, a person who reads about the symptoms of the common cold may decide to rest and drink fluids at home, rather than visiting a crowded clinic, which saves time for both patients and doctors. In addition, online forums and support groups help people connect with others facing similar challenges, which can be comforting and informative. On the other hand, not all medical information on the Internet is accurate or trustworthy. Many websites are not supervised by professionals and may offer misleading or even dangerous advice. If someone misinterprets their symptoms or self-medicates based on unreliable sources, this could delay proper treatment or worsen their condition. From my own experience, searching for minor issues online has sometimes been useful, but for more serious concerns, I always rely on a doctor’s opinion. In conclusion, while there are definite dangers in relying on the Internet for medical solutions, using it wisely can increase health literacy and convenience for many people, as long as individuals are careful to verify the quality of the information they find."
1359,2,"Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves, why is this happening?","Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves. What are the reasons? Is it a positive or negative trend?These days a vast majority of people want to lead an independent life. The fundamental reason lies in people’s educational qualifications that fuel their craving for freedom in life. This can be seen as a positive trend because living alone is likely to nurture a mature mindset at early stages of one’s life.Many people are well educated to stand up on their own. Tertiary education broadens their horizons, and they wish to experience freedom of life. With a very good educational background it becomes easier to find a well-paid job, and with lucrative income they gain confidence to lead an independent life, thereby achieving their goals. For example, engineering graduates can find a job in another town and their salary is enough for them to move and settle down there. This enables them to move away from their family and live on their own.Living alone helps one to develop maturity, which can be seen as a positive impact on individuals and the society as a whole. Being independent means young people have to face life challenges alone and going through this process improves their resilience. They become more responsible, as they have to take care of themselves and develop budgeting skills and saving habits, for their future needs as well. Better planning of their finances nurtures the custom of wise spending at early stages of adult life.In conclusion, the reason why many people wish to live independently these days is because their education level gives them both the awareness of freedom in life and means of achieving it. Since living alone promotes one’s maturity, it seems to be a positive trend in today’s society.This response covers the task requirements by addressing the two parts of the question, why people choose to live alone and whether this is a positive trend.

A range of complex sentence forms is used and there are no grammatical errors. Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.",,,,,,8.0,"In recent years, a growing number of individuals have chosen to live alone, and this phenomenon can be attributed to several main factors. One primary reason is the increasing emphasis on personal independence and self-reliance, which has become highly valued in modern society. Many people, especially the younger generation, want to make their own decisions and manage their lives without familial interference. Additionally, urbanization and economic development have created more job opportunities in different cities, prompting people to move for work and subsequently live by themselves. Higher incomes and financial stability also empower people to afford their private spaces. While some may argue that living alone might lead to loneliness or isolation, it often helps individuals build important life skills such as problem-solving, time-management, and self-discipline. By learning to handle daily tasks independently, people develop a sense of responsibility and confidence. Therefore, the trend of living alone, driven by personal growth and changing economic circumstances, can generally be regarded as a positive development, as it enables individuals to mature and adapt to the demands of adult life."

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Write at least 250 wordsEducation plays an imperative role in the overall progression of a country. Many people may heavily rely on quality education as preparation for real life employment and experiences. However, there are other factors that are needed to propel a country towards success.We must acknowledge the way the education system of a country prepares most individuals by equipping them with various skills. Prior to gaining a qualification to practice certain professions such as teaching, nursing or accounting, it is necessary for the individuals to undergo rigorous training. Certificate and diploma programs as well as university degrees are good examples of that. Some graduates may even choose to pursue further studies to attain certain requirements to be able to practice their chosen profession.The education system is undoubtedly important in preparing individuals to take on roles leading to the development of a country. However, it seems that producing graduates alone isn’t a guarantee of the advancement of a country. There are other factors that should come into play, and motivation of individuals is one. Without motivation, people may lose track of what they intend to do to contribute to the improvement of a country. drives people to achieve and maximize their potentials, because they are determined to get better at many aspects of their life, eventually yielding improvement for their entire country.Furthermore, the availability of natural resources and job opportunities may also affect the growth of a national economy. Innovations of many individuals require raw materials, and should the country be able to mine these, their production and perhaps even export may help in stabilizing the local market. Finally, it is also important that the availability of employment is aligned with the skills of individuals applying for the positions. Giving skilled people the opportunity to apply their knowledge and experience in their profession makes them more productive, which contributes to GDP growth.In conclusion, education continues to play a pivotal role in the development of a country.

A robust education system equips citizens with the necessary knowledge and skills to participate in the workforce and drive innovation, ultimately boosting the economy. Educational institutions also play a key role in fostering social values, critical thinking, and national cohesion, which are all essential for long-term progress. Nevertheless, development is a multifaceted process that demands attention to other aspects. For instance, a country’s political stability is necessary to ensure policies are effectively implemented, while good governance helps prevent corruption and misuse of resources. Additionally, access to technology and infrastructure, such as reliable transportation and energy, strengthens opportunities for growth and attracts foreign investment. Economic strategies that encourage entrepreneurship and create job opportunities are equally vital, as education alone cannot guarantee employment for everyone. Furthermore, healthcare systems contribute to a productive populace by ensuring citizens are healthy enough to study, work, and innovate. In summary, while education is undoubtedly fundamental to a nation’s advancement, a country’s development is the result of a balanced combination of political, economic, and social elements working in tandem. Only by recognizing and fostering all these factors can sustained and holistic progress be achieved."

Why do you think this is happening? What can be done to help children stay healthy?Write at least 250 wordsFor many years obesity was perceived as a condition occurring only in adult life. However, in recent years the number of children suffering from obesity has grown significantly. There are several causes and numerous solutions which can be used to tackle this worrying phenomenon, and this essay will present a couple of them.While some reasons for childhood obesity are genetic, others include poor food choices exacerbated by easy availability of fast food, insufficient physical activity and a history of family members being overweight. Unlike the former, the latter factors can be changed, if the adults in the child’s life gain awareness and are willing to take action.To begin with, health is a complex matter which requires a balanced approach. In other words, there isn’t a single solution to maintain health, on the contrary, it is rather a mixture of multiple factors, such as and regular physical activity. For this reason, increasing the awareness of healthy habits among children is a responsibility of utmost importance. What is more, it can be easily achieved through the education system.On the other hand, children’s education might to stop the situation from worsening. Along with well designed health education schemes, we should also try to stop food companies from overusing sugar in products the young ones. It has been proven that more than 70% of the products available in an average supermarket contain dangerously high levels of white sugar. Sugar rich diet not only causes a significant weight gain, but also contributes to diseases, such as diabetes in young population.To summarize, emphasis put on the awareness of healthy living among children is invaluable. Furthermore, combining healthy habits with stopping food companies from in products which are easily children can be effectively implemented by the governments.

Firstly, the increased consumption of processed foods and sugary beverages has played a major role in weight gain among young people, mainly because these options are often cheaper and more accessible than healthier alternatives. Moreover, the prevalence of screen-based entertainment such as television, computers, and smartphones has led to a decline in physical activity, as children are spending more time indoors and less time playing outside. Family habits also contribute; parents who do not prioritize balanced meals or active lifestyles may unintentionally encourage unhealthy behaviors in their children. In terms of solutions, schools and parents can work together to promote better eating habits by offering nutrition education and making healthy meals available in cafeterias. At the same time, governments can restrict advertisements for junk food targeted at children and implement regulations to limit the amount of sugar and unhealthy fats in food products. Furthermore, communities should invest in safe playgrounds, sports facilities, and organized physical activities so that children are encouraged to stay active. Ultimately, combating childhood obesity requires cooperation between families, schools, industry, and policymakers to foster environments where healthy choices are easy and appealing. By addressing the root causes and implementing effective solutions, we can help children achieve healthier lives and prevent serious health issues in the future."

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsMore and more young adults in our country are heavily indebted. Thus, it is considered by some that it should be mandatory to educate school children the administration of money. In my opinion, people should not leave school without a sound knowledge of financial management.To begin with, a country’s development is strongly upon the purchasing capacity of its inhabitants. That is to say, people who are in debt or financially vulnerable, would not be able to spend freely or invest, for example, in a new house, thus hindering the economic growth of the country. As a consequence, the rate of inflation would rise and people would be able to afford even less, which could ultimately result in the collapse of the entire economy. A good example of this vicious circle can be seen in countries such as Argentina, where people have to buy household items in the black market, because they cannot afford to buy them in regular stores due to skyrocketing prices. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to teach children early money management.Another point to consider is the low standard of living that people have when they mismanage their finances. Individuals who are constantly short of money could eventually end up being socially isolated and unhappy, because they couldn’t afford to participate in leisure activities, such as going to the cinema with a friend, resulting in their from social life. However, this could be avoided with ease by offering courses in money management.In conclusion, I strongly believe that school children should be taught how to manage their finances to prevent social isolation later in their life as well as to maintain the economic force of their country.The writer’s position is clear throughout the essay. Paragraphing is used effectively to organise ideas and information, however the paragraphs could have been balanced better in terms of the amount of content. The advanced vocabulary the writer uses creates a good impression of mature and fluent writer. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is fine, and the number of errors is small. The essay could achieve Band 8 in IELTS.",,,,,,8.0,"Education in financial management should undoubtedly be a compulsory subject in school curriculums, as sound money management skills are fundamental for both personal well-being and the health of a nation’s economy. Far too many young adults today leave school without a clear understanding of essential financial concepts such as budgeting, saving, investing, or the consequences of accumulating debt, which often leads to impulsive spending and long-term financial instability. When people lack these skills, they are at risk of making decisions that could result in overwhelming credit card bills or defaulting on loans, issues that are currently widespread among people in their twenties and thirties. Not only does this financial mismanagement negatively impact individuals’ abilities to buy homes, open businesses, or pursue higher education, but it also slows economic growth, as seen in countries experiencing financial crises due to poor collective money habits among the populace. For instance, if people understood the value of creating an emergency fund or the risks associated with payday loans, cases of bankruptcy or homelessness could potentially decline. Furthermore, being comfortable handling money encourages confidence and independence, allowing individuals to participate in society more fully, whether that means joining a gym or simply meeting friends at a café. While some may argue that financial management should be a family responsibility, it is important to recognize that not all parents possess the necessary expertise themselves or have the time to pass it on effectively. Therefore, making financial education a mandatory part of the school experience would ensure that every student acquires the financial literacy essential for a secure and fulfilling adult life, ultimately benefitting not just individuals, but society as a whole."

What is your opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsSome argue that dieting has an extraordinary impact on one’s life, whereas others are of a view that it absolutely adversely affects a person’s health. It cannot be denied that dieting taken to extremes may cause more harm than good, however, in my opinion effective dieting is pivotal for maintaining good health and keeping a more attractive body shape.First of all, the possibility of increasing level of physical health lies with incorporating proper dieting in our lives. It is reasonable to suggest that dieting is effective for controlling our body weight within an ideal range in order to achieve the normal score of body mass index (BMI), which is essential for preventing us from overweight or obese. As a result, the risk of suffering an illness will be reduced. A recent research concluded that dieting is one of the most effective measures to cut down one’s body weight among the obese group, and it helps to improve their medical condition indirectly.Moreover, dieting is crucial for keeping ideal body features regardless of gender and age. A fit and presentable body outlook absolutely boosts up one’s level in his or her social life, not to mention professions that require keeping one’s body in an attractive physical shape. For example, dieting is adopted as a popular way for reducing weight among actors and actresses. A recent article reported that an actress who successfully regained her slim body after a period of dieting was offered an excellent job opportunity in the Hollywood film industry.In conclusion, in my opinion dieting has a positive influence on one’s life in terms of maintaining a profound level of health and keeping a more attractive body outlook.The writer’s opinion is very clear from the start and throughout the entire essay. Paragraphing is used effectively to organise ideas and information. The use of advanced vocabulary enables accuracy of expression and highlights flexibility. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is good, with only a few errors made. The essay is a good example of an IELTS Band 8 work.",,,,,,8.0,"There is considerable debate about whether dieting benefits or harms individuals, with some believing it ultimately leads to better health while others feel it can destroy well-being. Personally, I am of the opinion that dieting, when approached thoughtfully and with proper guidance, can make a significant positive difference in a person’s life. One of the main reasons for this is that sensible dieting encourages the development of healthy eating habits, such as consuming a balanced mix of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins. Adoption of such habits not only helps manage weight but also contributes to preventing serious health conditions like diabetes and heart disease, a fact that has been supported by numerous medical studies. Additionally, a person who embarks on a structured and mindful diet plan often experiences improved energy levels and enhanced self-esteem, which can motivate further positive lifestyle changes. However, if dieting is taken to extremes or followed without considering an individual’s specific nutritional needs, it can indeed have dangerous consequences, such as malnourishment, eating disorders, or psychological distress. For example, fad diets that require cutting out entire food groups or severely limiting calorie intake are usually unsustainable and may cause more harm than good. Based on my own experiences, when I decided to consult a nutritionist and follow a well-balanced diet, I noticed marked improvements in both my physical health and mood. In conclusion, while there are definite risks associated with improper dieting, I believe that following a carefully planned, moderate diet can positively transform one’s life, supporting both health and happiness in the long run."
1364,2,Changing drivers age limits is the best way to reduce traffic accidents (from Target Band ,"This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskThe best way to reduce traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for elderly ones. Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsIn today’s world the number of traffic accidents is constantly rising as well as the number of injuries and deaths they cause. A better regulative approach is required traffic accidents can be reduced. Some people say that changing the drivers’ age limits is the best solution to the problem. However, there are other, more practical ways to deal with this problem.One alternative is imposing heavier fines the drivers who exceed the permitted alcohol consumption. According to recent , a great proportion of traffic accidents has alcohol as its reason. Utilising technology and installing devices that detect drunk drivers and lock car ignition can be used to keep people with track record of drunk driving off the roads. On some occasions and for repeat offenders in particular, a prison sentence may also be considered.Furthermore, people should be better educated and more careful while behind the wheel. To be more specific, people should learn to obey road rules and respect the other drivers instead of causing tension or submitting to road rage. In addition, heavy fines should also be levied for exceeded speed limits. Last but not least, safer and wider roads should be constructed to make for easier and more comfortable driving.Tightening age limits for drivers can be a complementary approach. For example, the elderly with vision problems or other important health issues should be excluded from driving. Besides, young people under 18 years old are considered immature to drive. However, maturity does not necessarily always increases with one’s age, which is why other measures are needed dangerous driving.In conclusion, I believe that stronger measures should be implemented for the prevention of traffic accidents, and drivers should have a more responsible attitude. Setting age limits could be helpful but should not be considered the optimal and only solution to the problem.The writer’s position is clear throughout the essay. There is a logical organisation of information and effective use of paragraphing. The range of vocabulary is wide enough for the student to show flexibility and accuracy of expression. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is good, with only a few errors made. The essay is up to the mark and is likely to get Band 8 in IELTS.",,,,,,8.0,"While adjusting the age limits for drivers may appear to be an effective way to decrease traffic accidents, it is not necessarily the most comprehensive or practical approach. Certainly, young drivers often lack experience and older individuals may face health issues that hinder their reaction time, but focusing solely on age overlooks other significant factors. For instance, stricter enforcement of traffic regulations and improved road safety education can play a much larger role in reducing accidents. Authorities could introduce advanced driving courses in schools to help young drivers develop safer driving habits before they are granted full licenses. In addition, campaigns promoting awareness about the dangers of distracted driving and excessive speed should be consistently reinforced. Another potential strategy is the implementation of technology, such as collision avoidance systems and automatic emergency braking, in all new vehicles. These tools can correct driver errors regardless of age, thus preventing many accidents. Furthermore, regular medical and vision checks for drivers of all ages would ensure that only those fit to drive are allowed on the roads, instead of relying on age as a general rule. All things considered, while age restrictions might reduce certain risks, the most effective approach to decreasing traffic accidents involves a combination of education, technology, and stricter law enforcement. Therefore, altering age limits alone is unlikely to address the root of the problem, and a multifaceted strategy is preferable for improving overall road safety."
1365,2,"IELTS Essay, topic: Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between the rich and poor, while others disagree (discuss)","Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between rich and poor people, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.There is no doubt that modern technology is reshaping our planet and affecting every aspect of human lives. From a social perspective, many people argue that the gap between the upper class and lower classes is widening as a result of technological advancements. Others, however, believe the opposite.There are several reasons why one could think that the wealth inequality is, indeed, increasing. The most common reason is automation. Driven by technology, automation reduces the need for manual labour. As a result, less work opportunities are available for unskilled people. With each iteration of the cycle the competition increases and wages decrease. , technology has increased the minimum level of needs that should be satisfied. Nowadays, everybody should have a mobile phone and an internet connection, including the poor. This increases the monetary burden on them as they must borrow to cover these new needs.However, I firmly believe that the aforementioned opinion is ludicrous. The most obvious reason is that modern technology has facilitated the road to riches in an unprecedented manner. For instance, many of the internet billionaires are from lower and middle classes. Moreover, the major leaps in agricultural technologies magnified food production. As a result, food has become more affordable and available. Finally, leveraging technology has dramatically increased workers’ productivity. Consequently, compensations and salaries have increased.In conclusion, I strongly believe that technology could possibly narrow the difference between social classes. Increased food production, opportunities and productivity are just few examples of technology’s contribution to bridging the wealth gap.This essay adequately covers all parts of the task. The ideas expressed in this written response are relevant, well-developed, ordered in a logical way and supported. The paragraphing is suitable and cohesion is maintained throughout the essay. A good range of vocabulary and the writer’s fluency are evident. There are no spelling errors and very few mistakes in word choice and grammar, most sentences are error-free. The essay is likely to get Band 8 in IELTS.",,,,,,8.0,"The notion that modern technology is playing a role in either widening or reducing the gap between the rich and poor is a subject of heated debate. On one hand, proponents of the view that technology increases inequality point out that the latest inventions often require substantial financial investment, such as access to computers, advanced smartphones, and high-speed internet. As a result, wealthier individuals or nations can harness new tools to boost their education, businesses, and lifestyles, while those with limited resources can fall even further behind. Furthermore, the rapid pace of technological change can make it difficult for low-income workers to compete, especially if automation replaces jobs that were once a major source of livelihood. On the other hand, many argue that technology has brought about more opportunities for everyone, regardless of background. For example, online education platforms and remote job opportunities can empower people from underprivileged communities to gain skills, find employment, or start businesses. Additionally, innovative healthcare solutions and mobile banking are increasingly accessible even in developing regions, helping reduce barriers related to poverty. Personally, I believe that while technology can initially emphasize existing disparities, its long-term potential to elevate the quality of life and foster equality is greater, provided there is intentional and inclusive policy-making. Therefore, technology itself is not inherently the cause of a widening gap; rather, it is the manner in which it is distributed and used that determines its effect on society."
1366,2,Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents (agree/disagree),"Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion and include relevant examples.It is true that parents need some knowledge and experience in order to raise their in an appropriate way. In this regard, many families attend different training courses. While I agree that these courses might be useful for some of them, I totally disagree with the recommended obligatory of such training.On the one hand, training courses usually offered by governments could be very useful for those guardians who have a with special needs. For example, if a child has a birth defect or has been diagnosed with any mental or musculoskeletal disorders, these kinds of training could be lifesaving. Additionally, as we know, the first few months after birth are really a crucial period of a child’s life; parents should obtain different information related to their child’s vaccinations, common health problems, different developmental issues and so on, which can be delivered through such training courses.On the other hand, I believe that making these programs a mandatory option would cause several problems for societies and individuals as well. To begin with, in order to achieve this goal, many professionals should be trained which may not be affordable for some governments. From an individual’s point of view, this kind of programs could be very time-consuming for some families who have other at home or who work long hours. The other important consideration is that parent training courses may not provide all the necessary information for each and every family. To be more specific, parents could get more beneficial information through different websites such as YouTube according to their own preferences.In conclusion, although I believe that many families can take advantage training courses, I do believe that making them a compulsory option for everyone is too time and money-consuming for individuals and governments.The introduction is very good and relevant. The writer’s position is balanced, relevantly and properly developed in two body paragraphs. The conclusion summarizes both sides of the argument and logically finished the essay. To maintain the necessary level of formality the word ‘kids’ should be replaced with ‘children’ everywhere in this essay. The use of prepositions needs more attention as some are inappropriate or incorrect. The length could be reduced – it’s not necessary to write a very long essay to get a higher score, and often it is better to write a shorter essay (no shorter than 250 words though!) but spend more time proofreading, correcting errors and improving the quality of writing. Overall this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.",,,,,,8.0,"There is no doubt that being a parent requires a variety of skills and knowledge to provide a nurturing environment for children. However, I do not believe that childcare training courses should be compulsory for all parents. On one hand, these courses can indeed offer valuable information, such as basic first aid, nutritional advice, and techniques for positive discipline, which could be beneficial, especially for first-time parents or those facing unique challenges. For instance, parents raising a child with health issues might benefit greatly from specialized courses that prepare them for specific situations. On the other hand, making these courses mandatory would create a number of difficulties for both individuals and the larger community. Many families may lack the time and resources to attend such programs, particularly if they work long hours or have multiple children. Additionally, the government would need substantial funding to organize high-quality courses accessible to everyone, which may divert resources from other essential services. Furthermore, parenting is a deeply personal experience, and many skills are learnt naturally or passed down from older generations; imposing a standardized curriculum could diminish the diversity of parenting techniques that exist within different cultures and families. In conclusion, while childcare courses can be helpful and should be available to those who wish to attend, making them mandatory for every parent is not practical nor reasonable, considering the potential burdens on both families and society."
1367,2,Many people believe that reducing speed limits is the best option for road safety improvement (agree/disagree),"Many people believe that reducing speed limits is the best option for road safety improvement. Do you think there are other measures that could be put in place? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?One of the most conspicuous trends of today’s world is a colossal surge in the number of vehicle accidents cars, trucks and buses, all over the , be it in impoverished or developed nations. There is a wide range of factors that . In my opinion, this situation could be remedied, provided some effective measures are taken.Measures to deal with this soaring concern are many; the most significant are not remote or complicated but accessible and practicable. The primary one lies in the fact that governments should take a firm stance and apply stringent rules and regulations to lower the speed limit. Secondly, using electronic devices while driving should be forbidden by law. Finally, an awareness program could be initiated by individuals to educate the public about the catastrophic effects of unsafe roads and the projected enhancements for road safety. Only when convergent efforts from all sectors are ensured, can we expect to see considerable progress in tackling this problem.There is a deluge of merits for implementation of reduced speed limits. High speed is likely to impose life threatening danger on people crossing the roads, due to the perilous nature of this hazardous speed with danger being an integral part of it. Not only does reducing the speed limits contribute to decreasing daily accidents, but it also raises the standard of driving. Needless to say, all these advantages have a far-reaching impact on pedestrian safety.There are, however, some pitfalls that can easily overpower the potential benefits of limiting speed. The primary one stems from the fact that slowing the speed could lead to augmenting the daily traffic hours. Besides, it could also delay delivering sick and patients to hospitals. Hence, it is apparent why some individuals are against changing the standardized level of speed.From what has been discussed, one can conclude that despite the drawbacks of reducing speed limits, the expected benefits of this measure are indeed far greater.All the parts of the task have been covered fairly well. The response presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt with suitable, widely covered and thoroughly supported ideas. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of task response. There are some mistakes in word choice and grammar. Nevertheless, the essay is up to the mark and is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.",,,,,,8.0,"Recently, the issue of enhancing road safety has sparked a vigorous debate, with many contending that decreasing speed limits represents the most effective remedy. While I acknowledge that limiting speed can result in fewer accidents given its direct influence on driver reaction time, I believe relying solely on this approach overlooks a broader spectrum of potential solutions. For instance, stricter enforcement of existing traffic laws, increased investment in public transportation infrastructure, and widespread educational campaigns on safe driving habits can significantly mitigate risks. Additionally, advancements in automobile technology, such as automatic braking systems and collision avoidance sensors, offer fresh layers of protection for all road users. That being said, lowering speed limits does possess significant merits—it reduces the severity of collisions and often provides motorists and pedestrians alike additional time to react, thus saving lives. On the flip side, excessively low speed limits may frustrate drivers, potentially resulting in erratic driving behavior or congestion, particularly in urban areas where traffic flow is critical. Moreover, for essential services like ambulances or fire trucks, rigid speed restrictions might compromise timely response. Overall, it can be asserted that while lowering speed limits brings tangible advantages, a multifaceted strategy combining regulation, education, technology, and enforcement would furnish a more comprehensive and lasting solution to the complex challenge of road safety."
1368,2,Nowadays families move to different countries for work and some think it has a negative effect on children (agree/disagree),"Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Recent advancements, in technology and transportation in particular, are reshaping our world in an unprecedented manner. Nowadays, it is not unusual for people to work abroad. Most expatriates relocate their families to the countries . Some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, however, I agree with those who believe the opposite is true.Those who think that relocating children to a new place is undesirable do so for many reasons. Their most common argument is the negative impact of moving on a child’s personality. There is no doubt that living in a different community comes with its challenges, especially to young people, as they get exposed to behaviours, actions and customs they might not be familiar with. As a result, children could possibly feel a lack of stability and some confusion. It is also likely that their patriotic feelings and sense of belonging to their home country could weaken as they would miss many opportunities to celebrate their national events.Nevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion to be ludicrous, as it seems that getting exposed to a new culture is beneficial in many ways. It fosters young social and emotional capabilities. Moreover, children living abroad have better opportunities to and practice new languages. Mastering more than one language improves not only their intellectual development, but also their opportunities in acquiring better jobs in the future. According to a recent study published by the University of Chicago, competency in more than one language increases employment chances on average by 200%.In conclusion, I strongly believe that living in a different country positively affects children in all aspects. Acquiring new languages, and an open minded and tolerant personality are just few examples of the many possible benefits.This essay presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt. The writer’s ideas are relevant and well‐supported. The arrangement of information and use of cohesive devices are fine, perhaps with a slight overuse in the second body paragraph. Sentence structures are complex, and the vocabulary is varied and appropriately used, except for some minor grammatical/spelling mistakes. This essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.",,,,,,8.0,"In today’s globalized world, it is increasingly common for families to move to different countries due to work opportunities, leading to a debate on whether this trend has a negative impact on children. Those who argue against international relocation often cite the emotional and social challenges children face, such as adapting to unfamiliar environments, coping with language barriers, and feeling disconnected from their home culture. These difficulties may initially cause stress and confusion, and some worry that children might struggle to establish a strong sense of identity or belonging. However, I believe the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. Living in another country allows children to develop resilience, cross-cultural understanding, and open-mindedness. They not only acquire new languages but also learn to appreciate diverse customs and perspectives, which are invaluable traits in a multicultural society. In fact, studies have found that children raised in international settings tend to perform better academically and socially due to their adaptive skills. Although the transitional period may pose obstacles, the long-term benefits regarding personal growth, global awareness, and future job prospects are undeniable. Therefore, I disagree with the viewpoint that moving abroad for work has a negative influence on children; on the contrary, it prepares them to thrive in an interconnected world."

Why do you think this is happening? What are some simple actions that could help the environment?It is commonly believed that preservation of natural resources is imperative, yet most people seem to exert no effort in doing so. Understanding the causes of this negligent attitude may help with devising some simple measures to safeguard the deteriorating environment.Lack of awareness is probably the foremost reason why the vast majority of individuals appears to be unmindful of the current environmental issues. Normally, people have tendency to downplay abstract problems, or those to happen in the distant future. This is because they are not properly informed of the possible detrimental effects of taking the environment for granted. To illustrate, residents in urban areas often deliberately dump their into the nearby creeks and drainage canals causing them to become clogged. It is only when devastating floods strike, that they come to realize the consequences of their actions.Some basic solutions that could be carried out are extensive awareness through all forms of communication and strict implementation of waste management. In addition to the traditional press, social media is a powerful means of disseminating information regarding the impending disasters and their potential hazards. This is a good way of persuading the public to actively take part in the campaign. Another straightforward solution, and by far the least anyone can do to help save the nature is disposing of garbage thoughtfully. Apart from avoiding throwing trash anywhere, everyone should practice proper segregation of biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable wastes at all times. These actions, when coordinated by the local governments, can be tremendously successful.In conclusion, while individual awareness is key to maintaining a healthy ecosystem, concerted efforts of governments and are much more effective in achieving such goal.The response is well written, it contains reasons, solutions and fully addresses the task.

Overall, this essay is likely to achieve Band 8 in IELTS.",,,,,,8.0,"While it is widely acknowledged that protecting the natural environment is essential, many people still refrain from making meaningful efforts to contribute to this cause. This discrepancy can be largely attributed to the perception that individual actions have little impact compared to the magnitude of environmental problems. Additionally, the fast-paced nature of modern life leaves individuals preoccupied with personal responsibilities, making environmental issues seem less immediate or pressing. For example, a person may recognize the importance of reducing plastic usage, but opt for convenience when shopping, especially in the absence of visible repercussions. Overcoming this apathy requires practical solutions that are accessible and easy to adopt in daily life. One effective approach is incorporating environmental education into community programs and schools, thereby raising awareness of the tangible effects of everyday choices. Furthermore, governments and organizations can facilitate eco-friendly behaviors by providing recycling bins in public spaces and encouraging the use of reusable bags and containers through incentives. By making sustainable options more convenient and raising consciousness around personal impact, society can bridge the gap between environmental beliefs and actual behaviors. In conclusion, fostering a sense of shared responsibility and simplifying environmentally friendly habits are key steps towards ensuring the preservation of our natural surroundings."
1370,2,People should not work beyond the retirement age (agree/disagree),"Some believe that people should not continue to work once they reach the age of retirement. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your experience.In recent years, with the improvement in healthcare sector and better , people are able to live longer and contribute to the economic progress of a nation more, compared to the past. Some see this as an entirely positive development, while others point out the drawbacks of working beyond the retirement age.Delaying retirement enables individuals to actively contribute to the society. On a personal level, working past retirement age provides an avenue for individuals to remain not only physically but also mentally active. Moreover, this option empowers the ageing population to be financially independent and economically self-sustainable past retirement age. In countries with growing ageing population such as Singapore, for instance, citizens are given an option to work beyond their retirement age based on the demands of their job and their capability to handle these tasks. Hence, working beyond retirement age empowers workers, ensures economic progression of the nation, and alleviates the challenges faced by an ageing population.On the flip side, working beyond the retirement age may result in adverse health impacts on workers and a decrease in productivity levels. In Japan, the suicide rates have recently been increasing due to rising stress levels at work faced by the ageing population who are pushed to work beyond their optimal capacity. Escalating stress levels from work to various health complications putting a strain on the healthcare system. Hence, working beyond retirement age may worsen the overall welfare of individuals and adversely impact the economy.To sum up, though working beyond retirement age health hazards leading to reduction in productivity levels, it seems to me that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, by assessing the capability of individuals and tailoring their jobs to their health profile, firms and companies should actively involve their workers to be productive beyond their retirement age.This essay is an excellent example of IELTS Band 8 writing.

Well done!",,,,,,8.0,"In modern societies, the question of whether individuals should work beyond the retirement age is frequently debated. While some argue that people should stop working at a certain age to enjoy well-deserved rest, I disagree with this view and believe that extending one’s working life can bring notable benefits both for individuals and for society as a whole. Firstly, many older people remain physically and mentally capable and wish to stay productive, and continued employment can offer a sense of purpose and routine, which has been linked to better mental health outcomes. For instance, in countries such as Germany and Australia, flexible work arrangements for seniors allow them to contribute according to their abilities, and this keeps them engaged and socially connected. Secondly, as life expectancy increases and the cost of living rises, financial security in old age becomes a concern; therefore, allowing older adults to work benefits their economic independence and reduces the burden on social welfare systems. On the contrary, opponents often point out that working beyond retirement could reduce job opportunities for younger generations and potentially strain the health of older workers. However, I believe these challenges can be mitigated by implementing policies such as part-time roles or consultancy positions for seniors, rather than imposing full retirement. In conclusion, while there are some drawbacks to working past retirement age, the advantages for both individuals’ well-being and the broader economy make it a favorable option, provided it is backed by appropriate support and flexible working options."

Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences to this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes.

This demographic shift poses several significant problems for individuals and society as a whole. One of the main concerns is the increased pressure on public health systems, as older people typically require more medical care and long-term support, which can lead to higher national spending on healthcare and social services. Furthermore, a shrinking working-age population means fewer people are paying taxes, potentially resulting in unsustainable pension systems and greater financial burdens on younger generations. Additionally, families may struggle to provide adequate care for ageing relatives while balancing their own work and personal responsibilities. To address these challenges, governments could raise the retirement age to keep more people economically active for longer, thus easing the strain on pension funds. Encouraging higher participation of older adults in the workforce, through flexible job arrangements and lifelong learning opportunities, can also help. Finally, supporting families and communities with resources and services for elder care, as well as considering policies that attract more working-age immigrants, would help maintain a balanced population structure. If these steps are taken, the negative effects of an ageing society can be managed and even turned into opportunities for growth and social cohesion."

The most pressing concern is likely to be the strain on healthcare systems, as older people generally need more medical attention and long-term care, which can lead to increased government spending and longer waiting times for treatment. In addition, with a smaller working-age population supporting a growing number of retirees, the social welfare system, including pensions, may become unsustainable, eventually resulting in higher taxes for workers or reduced benefits for the elderly. Families may also feel additional stress as they balance their own work responsibilities with caring for elderly relatives. To address these problems, governments could gradually raise the official retirement age, reflecting the fact that many people remain healthy and able to work later in life. Encouraging greater participation in the workforce by older adults and making workplaces more age-friendly could also help. Moreover, policies that support families, such as improved access to affordable care services or flexible working hours, would ease the burden on individual carers. Finally, promoting healthy lifestyles throughout life could help reduce healthcare costs by preventing chronic illnesses associated with ageing. In summary, although an ageing population brings several difficulties, a mixture of policy changes and support for both individuals and families can do much to lessen the negative effects."

Some people think this isn’t justified. Do you agree or disagree?While some believe that rewarding those in managerial positions with higher pay packets is appropriate, not everyone agrees with this view. Personally, I am leaning towards the latter position due to negative impacts caused by significant difference in salaries within a company.For one, executive officers should know that higher than sufficient salaries are not necessary. Indeed, the higher the remuneration they receive, the more likely the company to suffer from devoid of financial capability. Furthermore, they often gain powers that money can’t buy. For instance, they often make important decisions over how to make their company thrive. They are also entitled to allocate company’s budget and designate tasks to other workers. these non-financial entitlements, they should refrain from earning more than reasonable amounts as salaries.Unreasonably high salaries granted to the executives can also afflict other employees. In fact, it is foreseeable that many employees would feel powerless or even when they find out about the huge salary gap between the executive officers’ and theirs. Accordingly, some may leave the company, and others may go on to strike and demand a pay increase. However, those actions . Therefore, unfair salary systems like this would yield unhealthy working environment for both employers and employees.In conclusion, I oppose to those in managerial roles with obscene amounts of compensation because it can cost the company its prosperity and discourage other employees . Thus it is recommended for the company to decide on the salaries of executive officers and general workers by adopting a more motivating salary system.This is a good example of an IELTS Band 8 essay.

On one hand, proponents assert that the elevated responsibility and substantial decision-making power entrusted to executives warrant higher pay. They often navigate complex challenges and are accountable for the overall performance and direction of the entire organization, suggesting they deserve to be compensated accordingly. On the other hand, I tend to disagree with the notion that their salaries should vastly surpass those of other workers. Firstly, exorbitant disparities between managerial and employee salaries can lead to resentment in the workplace, eroding morale and diminishing teamwork. In addition, many regular employees contribute significantly to the daily operations and success of the company, but their efforts are frequently undervalued in monetary terms. If such inequalities continue unchecked, it might foster high staff turnover, lower productivity, and create an unhealthy company culture. In conclusion, while senior managers play an essential role, overly generous salaries for them can create negative consequences; therefore, a more balanced and equitable approach to employee compensation is advisable."
1374,2,Advertising affects what people think is important and has a negative effect on their lives (agree/disagree),"Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?With the advent of the Internet, advertisements, originally displayed only on TV, billboards, posters and so on, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and commonplace for the general public. In my view, this kind of impact could be both crucial and, on a certain level, detrimental.On the one hand, this phenomenon could denote that although we have already had a diverse range of , people are still capable of inventing innovative approaches catering for all kinds of requirements of advertising. It is a symbol that demonstrates the creativity rooted in human beings. Apart from that, it also represents that the speed of spreading information is conspicuously escalating. More purposeful is, therefore, the fact that, besides booming of the advertising, it constitutes a major reason why people could be so prosperous in this digital age.On the other hand, there are various unpleasant consequences as well. Firstly, with the omnipresent , it could potentially cause people to do impulsive shopping. Secondly, the , if regulated in a mismanaged , could make people constantly feel uncomfortable or annoyed. In this sense, instead of being an instrumental tool to promote amenities, advertisements could be considered a hindrance when people are frequently blocked by them. Furthermore, it would cost one precious time to have to sift the helpful ad from a host of others.In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, advertising is a beneficial phenomenon for all with a number of insignificant drawbacks. I believe that in the future we can improve the way advertising is done at present, and embrace the positive influence of advertising even further in the long run.This essay is another example of what Band 8 writing may look like. It’s weak point is that the author goes slightly off-topic while trying to discuss whether advertising affects what people view as important and instead talks about the reason advertising is spreading and about human creativity. However, the other part of task type (negative effects of advertising) is covered well, the ideas are well-developed and supported. There is a clear logical flow of information and a range of transitional words is used appropriately to sequence ideas. The way author uses synonyms to rephrase the task topic in the intro paragraph demonstrates their lexical skill, which is also evident in other parts of this essay. There are many complex sentences and very few errors. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.0.",,,,,,8.0,"In today’s world, advertising has infiltrated nearly every aspect of daily life, leaving many to wonder whether it unduly shapes people’s perceptions of what truly matters and whether this influence is predominantly harmful. Personally, I believe that advertising does in fact distort priorities and has a palpable negative effect on individuals and society. On the one hand, advertisements are specifically designed to draw attention to products or services, often exaggerating their importance and making people feel as though owning certain things is essential for happiness or social acceptance. This relentless emphasis on material goods can encourage a culture of overconsumption and lead individuals, especially younger audiences, to value possessions over more meaningful pursuits. Moreover, advertising can instill feelings of inadequacy or discontent by consistently showcasing unattainable lifestyles, which may harm self-esteem and foster unnecessary competition. While it is true that advertising keeps people informed about new options and can stimulate economic activity, I feel these benefits are outweighed by the ways in which advertisements manipulate desires, blur the line between wants and needs, and distract people from genuine values such as relationships and personal growth. In conclusion, the pervasive nature of advertising does shape public perception of what is important, contributing to negative outcomes that should not be overlooked."
1375,2,Many believe that international tourism is bad for their country (reasons and solutions),"Many people believe that international tourism is a bad thing for their countries. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to change this negative attitude towards international tourism?Many individuals think that foreign tourism brings negative effects to their countries. There are several reasons for such negative attitude towards international travelers. However, a couple of solutions could be adopted to handle this situation, as will now be discussed.International tourists are often criticized for their contribution to the environmental degradation. It has continuously been noticed that they throw rubbish in their surroundings irresponsibly, which increases the amount of litter everywhere, despite all attempts to reduce waste produced by the local community. This contributes to water, air and soil contamination.Furthermore, foreign tourism has a harmful influence on traditional customs and indigenous practices of host countries because many tourists are careless and insensitive the emotions and feelings of local residents. For instance, in India, some foreign travelers wear inappropriate clothes or expose too much of skin when they visit sacred places, which leads to some negative attitude and the local public.However, this situation can be improved different solutions which could be handled by the government. The government should explain the benefits of international tourism which contributes to the development of local . They not only spend money in shops and restaurants but also create jobs in service industries, and this aspect could be publicized. Additionally, the government should increase the awareness among the foreigners through different media such as roadside billboards and advertisements, and tourists should be encouraged to get rid of rubbish correctly.In conclusion, the inhospitable feeling that the local people have for international tourists can be explained in many ways. However, in my opinion, the government’s involvement is essential to change the negative attitude by citing various advantages of international tourism to their country and raising awareness among tourists in order to protect local habitats.This essay covers the entire task topic by exploring both reasons for negative attitude towards international tourism and some possible actions to change it. The writer explains why locals may resent international tourists and suggests what steps can be taken to transform the way people feel about foreigners in their country. The information is well-organised by the use of paragraphing, and the writer moves from one idea to the next effortlessly, with the help of linking words. A wide range of vocabulary is used, including less common words such as “degradation”,”inhospitable”, “habitat”, “awareness” and “sacred”. Instances of inaccurate word choice are rare, and even these slips don’t cause difficulty for the reader. Overall, this looks like a Band 8 essay.",,,,,,8.0,"Many people are concerned that international tourism can have adverse effects on their country for a variety of reasons. Firstly, a key issue is cultural disruption; when tourists visit, they may not respect local traditions or customs, which could lead to the erosion of cultural identity. For example, tourists might ignore religious norms, behave inappropriately in sacred places, or dress in ways that locals find disrespectful. Secondly, the influx of visitors often leads to environmental problems, such as an increase in litter, pollution, and damage to natural sites, especially in fragile areas that are not equipped to handle large crowds. Besides, international tourism can drive up prices for food, housing, and other essentials, making life more expensive for local residents. To address these concerns, it is important for the government and tourism authorities to educate both locals and tourists about mutual respect and the importance of preserving local traditions. Information leaflets, signs, and orientation programs can help foreigners understand and follow local rules. Moreover, strict regulations should be enforced to protect the environment, such as limiting the number of visitors in ecologically sensitive areas and promoting sustainable tourism practices. If these solutions are put into practice, negative attitudes towards international tourists could be reduced, and a more positive relationship between visitors and residents could be fostered."
1376,2,Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research (discuss),"Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research for the benefit of human beings, while others argue that it is wrong. Discuss both views and give your opinion.People have different views on how medical research should be conducted and tested. Although many people support the use of for developing medicines, I personally believe that animal testing is morally wrong.The main reason why some people value to conduct medical research is because animal testing has contributed to many life-saving cures and treatments. It is true that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. For example, experiments in which dogs had their pancreases removed led directly to the discovery of insulin, critical to saving the lives of diabetics. Furthermore, it is impossible to release to the market before proving it no harm to humans and laboratory mice are appropriate research subjects because they are similar to human beings in many ways.However, I people who consider medical development that involved the use of animals cruel and unacceptable. I believe that the lives of all creatures should be respected and we, humans, have no right to for our own benefits. Governments should invest in developing alternative methods that can replace when doing medical research. For example, a software program can be developed to model a human immune system and new drugs can be tested on the software rather than animals. In this way, no animals will suffer from the medical tests and the society can still benefit from medical development.In conclusion, although it is undoubtedly true that animal testing has helped scientists in drug developments and medical discoveries, I believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused to animals and we should use alternative methods when doing medical research that do not involve animals suffering.This is a great essay. It addresses the two sides of the argument by exploring reasons why animals should and should not be used in medical research. The ideas are well explained and supported by examples. The use of paragraphing is efficient and helps with logical sequencing of ideas. Linking words are used appropriately to achieve the necessary cohesion. Author’s meaning is skillfully conveyed by the use of wide range of vocabulary. Even though there are some inaccurately used expressions, they don’t hinder understanding. Most sentences are error-free, instances of faulty grammar are rare. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.",,,,,,8.0,"Many people believe that using animals in medical research is justified as it leads to important discoveries that save human lives, while others feel that it is an unethical practice. On one hand, proponents of animal testing argue that it plays a crucial role in advancing medical science. For instance, studies on animals have made it possible for scientists to create vaccines and treatments for life-threatening conditions, which would have been difficult to develop using only computer models or cell cultures. Additionally, some diseases affect complex organs and whole organisms, so animal research can provide insights that cannot be achieved by other means. On the other hand, there are strong arguments against the use of animals in medical experiments. Many people see it as cruel and unnecessary, claiming that animals are sentient beings and deserve respect and protection from harm. Critics also argue that the results from animal testing do not always translate well to humans, which puts into question the effectiveness and necessity of these practices. In my opinion, while I recognize the immense contributions animal research has made to medicine, I believe that greater efforts should be made to find alternative methods. Investing in new technology such as sophisticated computer simulations or using tissue cultures could reduce the need for animal testing, ultimately minimizing animal suffering. In conclusion, medical research involving animals has contributed significantly to scientific progress, but society should strive to limit its use and seek out more ethical alternatives where possible."

In my opinion, if the city offers security and green areas, I agree it is a better place to raise the next generation some advantages both sides.Firstly, the countryside in touch with nature, taking care of animals and helping with the gardening. Because of that, they learn how to protect the environment and to live without any technological equipment. Besides that, they have more freedom to play outside the house without any security worries, whereas in the city they are kept at home smartphones and computers for this reason. On the other hand, schools usually have lower quality and it is hard to find extracurricular classes.

In the countryside, children are often surrounded by nature, which lets them experience fresh air, open spaces, and a slower pace of life. This natural setting can encourage imagination and provide a sense of freedom, as children have more space to explore and play with fewer safety concerns. However, rural areas often lack high-quality schools and a wide range of activities, which may make it hard for children to develop certain skills or pursue special interests. In contrast, cities usually offer better educational facilities, more extracurricular activities, and greater exposure to different cultures. This variety can help children discover what they are passionate about and develop social skills as they interact with people from different backgrounds. On the downside, city living often means dealing with pollution, noise, limited green spaces, and safety concerns, so parents might feel less comfortable letting their children play outside unsupervised. In conclusion, while rural areas can offer a peaceful and safe childhood close to nature, cities generally provide more opportunities for learning and personal growth, so the best option depends on what parents value most for their children’s development."

1379,2,should unpaid community work be mandatory in high school (agree/disagree)?,"Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programs (for example working for a charity, improving the neighborhood or teaching sports to younger children). To what extent do you agree or disagree?It is argued that voluntary services charity, cleaning the neighborhood, imparting knowledge to the underprivileged, should be made mandatory in the high school curriculum. I strongly agree as it not only helps in students becoming socially responsible adults but also in shaping their character.Firstly, community service inculcates a sense of responsibility towards the society, something that is needed to shape a good society. For instance, the introduction of Swatch Bharath scheme in my school, The Hyderabad Public School, ten years ago taught me not only to keep the surroundings of the school clean but also to never litter wherever I go. Hence, now I feel responsible to maintain cleanliness everywhere. Such services are needed to develop a better society in the future.Secondly, voluntary services cater to the overall character development of an individual. It a feeling of empathy in children which is needed to build a better character. For example, an alumnus of Montessori High School, who indulged in petty law-breaking activities during school confessed that it was the charity service that he did in high school; which in his mind; him in becoming a better person for his family and refrained him from committing socially irresponsible acts. Thus, such voluntary activities teach us to value what we have and in turn to our personality development.That being said, we cannot deny the fact that many students misuse the time allocated for these services by considering it as an excursion to enjoy with friends rather than a learning .In conclusion, although compulsory voluntary community service has its drawbacks, it is still useful in shaping a child as a socially responsible citizen and also in their overall personality development. Therefore, pupils should be encouraged to involve themselves in such activities.This is a well written essay. It addresses all parts of the task and the arguments and ideas are developed and supported. The information is presented in a logical order and the ideas are linked by appropriate connective words. The use of vocabulary conveys the exact meaning of the writer and there are only minor instances of a word being used somewhat unnaturally.

Overall this essay seems good enough for IELTS Band 8 level.",,,,,,8.0,"It is often debated whether unpaid community service should be a compulsory aspect of high school education, such as volunteering with charities, organizing neighborhood projects, or providing guidance to younger students. I firmly believe that integrating mandatory community work in high school curricula brings numerous benefits for both individuals and society. Firstly, participating in such activities equips students with practical life skills beyond the classroom, like teamwork, problem-solving, and leadership, which are invaluable for personal development. For example, during a school-organized park cleanup in my town, students learned how to manage time, delegate tasks, and take collective responsibility for their environment. Additionally, compulsory service fosters empathy and social awareness by exposing young people to diverse communities and real-life challenges, encouraging them to become more considerate and active citizens. Of course, some students may view the requirement as burdensome or may not engage sincerely, but with proper guidance and reflection, most students can gain meaningful experiences and a sense of accomplishment. In conclusion, making unpaid community work mandatory in high school not only builds character and broadens students’ understanding of society but also contributes to the development of more responsible future citizens; therefore, I strongly support this initiative."
1380,2,Why do criminals commit another offence after being punished?,"Many offenders commit more crimes after serving the first punishment. Why is this happening, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?It is true that some criminals commit crimes again after they have been punished. While there are several reasons for this alarming trend, some effective measures can be taken by governments to tackle this problem.There are two main reasons for re-offenders. Firstly, the prison system can make the situation worse. Criminals put together in prison and they make friends with other offenders. While they are locked up in prison, they do not have much to do there, and they would exchange information about what they have done before they came to the prison or they may plan crimes with other inmates. Secondly, offenders often do not have any other means of earning money. They are poor, uneducated and lacking skills needed to maintain a job. Also, a criminal record makes finding a job difficult as people usually avoid hiring .To solve this problem, governments should focus on rehabilitation of criminals rather than punishment. Above all, prisons need vocational training which inmates to prepare for life outside the prison. They can learn practical skills such as computer programming, car maintenance and graphic design. In this way, they can be hired for a position that requires this certain knowledge and skills. Community service is another way to reform offenders. Rather than being locked up in prison with other inmates, offenders can help society and become useful to their local community, and these activities would eliminate the negative influence that prisons can have.In conclusion, it is true the one of the problems our community; it can be solved by focusing rather than punishment itself.This is a good essay.

Overall this looks like an IELTS Band 8 essay.",,,,,,8.0,"There are various reasons why many criminals reoffend after having served their initial punishment. The first major cause is the lack of effective rehabilitation within prisons. Instead of reforming offenders, prisons often become a breeding ground for further criminal behavior by exposing inmates to hardened criminals and promoting negative influences. Furthermore, after release, ex-convicts face significant difficulties in reintegrating into society. They struggle to find stable employment because of their criminal record, which leads to financial hardships and a sense of exclusion. This situation makes a return to crime seem like the only viable option for survival. To tackle this problem, governments should focus on providing better support systems for ex-offenders, such as job training, counseling, and educational programs both inside and outside prisons. Additionally, promoting community-based sentencing for minor crimes rather than imprisonment would help reduce the negative impact of incarceration. By addressing the underlying issues that lead individuals back to crime, society can decrease the rate of repeat offences and help offenders lead productive lives."

However, from my perspective, I disagree with this contention.Admittedly, mixed ability classes provide a better environment for children’s all-round development. In such classes, children with different abilities study together and in turn they can learn from one another. From example, a student, who is good at academic study but weak in dancing or painting, can learn how to dance or paint his peers. In this sense, mixed ability classes allow students to develop their abilities in different subjects instead of only academic abilities.Despite the argument above, I believe streaming students brings more benefits to teachers and students.

This targeted approach may provide an environment where gifted students are challenged and slower learners receive the support they need. On the other hand, opponents claim that dividing students by their grades can lead to negative social effects, such as decreased self-esteem among those placed in lower groups and a lack of diversity in the classroom. Mixed-ability classes, they argue, promote cooperation and empathy, as students of varying talents work and grow alongside one another. From my perspective, while grouping by ability can be beneficial for specific subjects like mathematics or science, overall, a mixed-ability environment better prepares students for the real world, where people of all backgrounds and skills must collaborate. Ultimately, education should not only focus on academic achievement but also on nurturing well-rounded individuals with social awareness and adaptability."

For instance, lesson plans can be customized so that high-achieving students engage with complex material, whereas those struggling academically can focus on strengthening their foundation, thus potentially boosting overall academic outcomes. On the other hand, advocates of mixed-ability classes assert that diverse classrooms promote personal growth beyond academics, as students learn to cooperate with and appreciate peers of differing strengths. Furthermore, this arrangement may cultivate essential social skills such as empathy, teamwork, and patience, which are crucial in later life. After weighing both perspectives, I personally believe that grouping students solely by academic performance may inadvertently generate feelings of inadequacy among lower performers and excessive pressure among higher achievers.

1383,2,"Children these days are suffering from obesity, why and how can it be solved?","Modern children are suffering from the diseases that were once considered to be meant for adults only. Obesity is a major disease prevalent among children. What are its causes and what solutions can be offered?Nowadays, the increasing rate of overweight children and adults is a worldwide health issue. Obesity is a major problem which is increasing day by day in children. There are various reasons behind it. This essay will discuss the causes of obesity and offer some solutions.The first cause of obesity is junk food. It is often seen that mostly children are fond of burgers, pizzas, noodles and . These types of foods are easily available to them in school canteens. Children love to purchase chips, , ice-cream for lunch. Moreover, in this modern era, parents are working and they do not have time to cook at home. Parents often buy dinner for their children instead of preparing food at home. This calorie-rich diet is making children obese. This problem can be solved by teaching children to cook healthy foods for themselves and banning junk foods and fizzy drinks in schools. This diet can be replaced by milk, juice and fruits for lunch.The second cause of obesity is . It is true that the use of computers and television is increasing children. They spend most of their time watching television or playing video games on a computer. This technological advancement has reduced the level of physical activity in this specific age group. This issue can be resolved by encouraging children to do physical exercises. Parents can take their children to park to encourage playing with friends. Furthermore, schools can add sports in their curriculum to maintain physical fitness in their students.To sum up, it is clear that main causes of obesity are unhealthy eating and not enough physical activities. This ailment can be prevented and treated by healthy eating and physical exercises.This is a good essay.

Overall, this work seems worthy of IELTS Band 8. Keep up the good work!",,,,,,8.0,"In recent years, childhood obesity has become an alarming concern for families and societies worldwide. Many factors contribute to this issue, the most significant being poor dietary habits and a sedentary lifestyle. Children today often prefer processed and fast foods that are high in sugar, fat, and salt, instead of healthier options like vegetables and fruits. Moreover, the increase in screen-based entertainment, such as television, computers, and smartphones, has drastically reduced the amount of time children spend outdoors engaging in physical activities. Another reason is the busy schedule of parents, which often leads to reliance on ready-made meals rather than home-cooked, nutritious food. To combat this growing problem, it is important to encourage children to eat balanced meals and limit the availability of junk food, especially in schools and at home. Schools can play a vital role by offering more physical education classes and promoting sports and outdoor games. Parents should also set a good example by making healthier food choices and participating in activities with their children. In summary, while childhood obesity is caused mainly by unhealthy eating and lack of exercise, it can be controlled and prevented through a combination of nutritious diets and regular physical activity."

While some argue that having some employment experience is conducive to a child’s learning and development, I contend that it would bring harm to the child’s and learning.First of all, a workplace designed for adults normally child-friendly facilities. Desks and chairs are too high for a child; the light switches are installed on the walls unreachable children; also emergency training and facilities such as phones are only provided to adults. Furthermore, various hazards such as polluted air and chemical fumes are still produced in factories and farms. Undoubtedly young people would suffer in such workplaces.Also, children would find it frustrating when they are not properly inducted before starting a job. A child working in a cement factory would feel a setback when he could not get immediate support while struggling with the procedures of recording different raw materials that required by the job. Further, without sufficient support, a child’s misunderstanding or inappropriately communicating with adults would only disappoint him and prevents him from active learning and interacting with other people.To conclude, a child’s paid employment experience would lead to a negative impact on their health and active learning. However, recognizing the importance of children’s learning and their awareness of responsibility, it is advisable to encourage them to be involved in some volunteering opportunities where they can meaningfully learn and interact with other people with sufficient care and support in place for such jobs.This is a good essay. There are only a few errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections), but otherwise this work seems worthy of Band 7.5 or 8. Remember to always proofread your essay before submitting it. Keep up the good work!",,,,,,8.0,"The question of whether children should be involved in paid work is one that often generates significant discussion. On one hand, proponents argue that exposure to working environments can teach children valuable life skills and help them develop a sense of independence and responsibility. However, I believe that engaging children in paid employment is detrimental to their development and well-being. Firstly, most workplaces are not designed with children in mind and may expose them to dangers that can jeopardize their health and safety, such as heavy machinery, hazardous materials, or long working hours. Furthermore, paid work can interfere with a child’s education, making it difficult for them to focus on their studies and decreasing their opportunities for academic success. In addition, being placed in a stressful or demanding job can negatively impact a child’s emotional and social development, especially if they are not given proper guidance or support. Rather than participating in paid work, I think children should be encouraged to engage in other enriching activities, such as volunteering or creative pursuits, which foster personal growth in a safer and more supportive environment. In conclusion, while work experience has its benefits, children should not be involved in paid employment, as it is likely to hinder their educational progress and overall development."
1385,2,Should people spend a lot on weddings and birthday parties?,"Some people think that spending a lot on holding wedding parties, birthday parties and other celebrations is just a waste of money. Others, however, think that these are necessary for individuals and the society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Throwing parties can be expensive. While some people do not find these fancy gatherings worth what they cost, others believe such events are important to both individuals and the society.People choose to throw parties for a number of reasons. For starters, they can make better teams. Project kick-off parties are good opportunities to break the ice and help team members to know each other better. Celebrating a victory create a sense of success and belonging. Companies do not see parties as of money and allocate budget to support such events; moreover, they often leave good memories. From our own experiences, we all have happy memories of our birthday parties when we were little. Every family has great photos at family gatherings in their album. In addition, contrary to what some people believe that spending on parties is a waste of social resources, they actually create value, either by employing people in the party-planning business or by offering people better experiences.The popularity of parties, however, causes some tension in the society. They are hard on introverted people who find themselves uncomfortable in the crowd. This is a clinic symptom which psychologists call “social anxiety disorder”. There are other ways to celebrate important events that may have greater value for their cost. For instance, companies could send out gifts after successful projects and parents could take their children on family trips to celebrate birthdays.In my opinion, while a party is a form of social event that brings many benefits to individuals and the society, other choices should also be considered, either to cut spending or to relieve the stress of those who are not fond of crowded celebrations.This is a very good essay. Other than minor inaccuracies there are no problems (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Seems to be worth IELTS Band 8.",,,,,,8.0,"There is much debate about whether people should spend a lot of money on weddings and birthday parties. Some people argue that spending heavily on these occasions is unnecessary and wasteful, as the money could be used for more meaningful purposes, such as education, travel, or charity. They also point out that extravagant celebrations can create social pressure, making others feel obliged to spend beyond their means just to keep up. On the other hand, supporters believe that such events are important milestones in a person’s life and deserve to be celebrated in a memorable way. Weddings and birthdays are not only personal achievements but also bring families and friends together, strengthening relationships and creating lasting memories. The celebrations can also benefit the local economy by providing income to event planners, caterers, and other service providers. In my view, while it is understandable that people want to mark significant events in a special way, it is not necessary to spend excessive amounts to do so. A thoughtful and joyful celebration does not depend on the size of the budget, but rather on the people involved and the spirit of the occasion. Ultimately, individuals should feel free to celebrate in ways that are meaningful to them, without undue pressure to impress others or spend more than they can afford."
1386,2,Some people think that students who don’t take a break in studies between the high school and the university are at disadvantage compared to students who travel and work after high school before further continuing their education. Do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, in our competitive world, to succeed, knowledge from school and university is not enough. Therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too, compared to those who travel or work and get experience and skills . There are two following reasons to support for my opinion. I refer to the group of people who study from school to university as ‘group A’ and the other group – as ‘group B’.Firstly, at school and university, what group A gains is almost entirely theory, theory and theory. Of course, theory is very , however, you can’t do everything with just theory. You must have experience. This is what group A . Although in the third or fourth year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they aren’t trained well because of the short time spent working. And the real job is still very strange to them. After graduating, without experience, group A students can’t accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned. Therefore, group A students can contribute less than group B who have the two most important things: skills and experience.Secondly, as group A students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many companies which employ people in group A have to train them from ground-up. These companies take this cost from group A’s salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained. So, less benefits are unavoidable and certain, group B members are more loyal and effective workers. They also have useful experience and skills. Besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group A. As the result, group B gets more benefits absolutely.In conclusion, I think a student should travel or work before going to the university. That way, not only will they have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them to get a good job and have a brilliant future.","This essay is too long (350 words instead of 250). To fight this problem, try to write in a more general form and provide fewer details. The use of language and ideas are good and so is the essay structure. Seems worthy of Band 7.",,,,,7.0,"In my opinion, students who take a break to travel or work before starting university enjoy distinct advantages over those who move straight from high school to higher education. First, students who experience the world or workforce before university gain practical knowledge that cannot be learned from textbooks alone. For example, traveling helps young people become independent and resourceful, while working teaches responsibility and exposes them to real-life challenges. These skills prove valuable during university studies and in their future careers. In contrast, students who go directly to university after high school may lack these abilities, making it harder for them to adapt to new situations or solve unexpected problems. Furthermore, time spent outside academics allows young adults to discover their interests and passions, leading them to make wiser decisions about what to study in university. As a result, these students are often more motivated and focused. In summary, I believe that taking time to travel or work between high school and university gives students important life experience and better prepares them for success in their education and future endeavors."
1387,2,"We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?","Today computers are used almost everywhere, it is impossible to imagine our life without PCs, Internet, mobile phones and other computer devices. It is reasonable to think that people look forward to the future of computers., computers make our life easier, we can easily get information about any product we plan to buy or place we plan to visit in a second using a personal computer and . Scientists predict that in the nearest future it will be possible to smell a new perfume using the Internet and watch 3D scenes at home like we do in the movie theater. According to forecasts of HR agencies machines will replace jobs of cashiers, and civil and military pilots. Some corporations in Japan are already sellinghousewife-robots, which help old people to keep their homes clean.Despite the fact that computers help us, they make us dependent. Apparently, people spend more time behind monitors than ever before. And some of them feel a need for more time to be spent with people in live contact. In addition, a breakdown of one of the important modules of a specific computer can entail serious consequences. to mention the computer problem that occurred in the end of 1990s, a problem related to the coming year 2000 (Y2K) and catastrophes that were predicted.

In the future, computers could be much more involved in healthcare, for example, by diagnosing diseases earlier than doctors or even performing surgeries with high precision. Education may change too, as virtual classrooms and personalized digital tutors could become more common, giving students around the world equal opportunities to learn. Nevertheless, relying so much on computers has some downsides. If systems break down or are hacked, our daily routines could be disrupted and personal information could be at risk. Furthermore, as we let computers make more decisions for us, we may lose important skills or become less connected with others. Overall, while computers make life easier and open new possibilities, we must be careful not to let our dependence grow unchecked. It is necessary to balance the benefits with careful consideration of the risks to ensure that society stays secure, healthy, and connected."
1388,2,"In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?","Nowadays, many children involved in different types of jobs to have some kind of financial assurance for themselves. However, whether this is good for their development and personality is a controversial issue. I personally believe that paid works is harmful for children for several reasons.It is said that children gain valuable experience in the work place. This may be true. However, I would argue that children are mainly employed in jobs that require manual work and are poorly paid. The recent statistics reveal the common tasks that children are assigned to are washing dishes, mopping floors or serving food in restaurants. Meanwhile, this kind of jobs actually provide children with necessary and useful skills to apply in their future .This brings me to the second point. Defenders of child labour that it is an effective method of learning. The point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to them in a real life working environment. Although this is undoubtedly true, it also means that children may neglect the classroom study and even fail the class. The worst thing is yet to come. They may become so preoccupied with the benefits ahead of them such as small salary that they may leave school.Finally, supporters say that it helps them to build responsibility in the family. They will understand how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have compassion for their parents. This is true to a certain extent, but may have a totally adverse effect on children. As children can make money at an early age, they would feel that it is appropriate to spend it on luxury things.In conclusion, I think that parents should take measures to restrict their child from work, otherwise it would have negative consequences to their future.","This is a great essay, a Band 7+ candidate.

In my view, while there are some benefits to children gaining early work experience, the drawbacks far outweigh them. For one thing, most jobs available to children are low-skilled and offer little in terms of actual learning or long-term value, often involving simple tasks such as delivering newspapers or assisting in small shops. These activities may provide a sense of responsibility, but they can also interfere significantly with children’s education, leaving them tired and unable to focus on their studies. Furthermore, child labor can sometimes be exploited, leading to unsafe working environments and unfair wages, which may harm children's physical and mental development. Although earning money might help some families in financial difficulty, I believe that the government and society should find better solutions than putting the burden on young shoulders. Ultimately, children should prioritize their education and personal growth, and their involvement in paid work should be carefully limited to ensure their well-being and future prospects."

With the help of the , you can reach out and get to know people you might never have met in person. Articles can be co-authored, business deals can be finalized, degrees can be earned and at times even medical advice can be given- and all of this is just a click away.Electronic mail, instant messages, web cameras and microphones; all these gadgets and programs make the presence of the other person more real. Who knows; with the help of visual reality you might even get a 3-D image of the speaker! I believe that the Internet is one the best inventions of the last century, you can hardly get to miss anyone and nobody is really out of reach. You can keep in touch with your friends, and be able to do your work from your bedroom in your pajamas!However, the internet can also be a major source of harassment. Spammers and hackers can invade your privacy and get personal/confidential information, which otherwise they never get access to. You are never out of anybody’s reach, unless you make a conscious decision of not checking your email, there can be always more work waiting for you in your inbox and you might never have a moment to yourself. Worse yet, if you were a workaholic, you might never experience that stress-free vacation ever again in your life – simply, because you have your mobile workplace with you at all times.As a romantic, I will always look forward to getting an occasional letter in the snail mail.

With just a few keystrokes, individuals can connect with friends, family, or colleagues living continents apart, making the distance seem almost non-existent. Video chats, social networking sites, and instant messaging have truly transformed how we share ideas and maintain relationships, often in real time. From collaborating on group projects with international classmates to staying updated on world events through online communities, the possibilities for meaningful interaction seem limitless. However, it’s also important not to ignore the downsides. Miscommunications can occur easily without face-to-face cues, and sometimes, real friendships are replaced by superficial online connections. In spite of these challenges, I believe the Internet has made it substantially easier for people to communicate with one another, bringing cultures closer together and enabling voices from all walks of life to be heard. The convenience and speed offered by digital communication make it an essential part of our modern existence, even if we must remember to balance it with genuine, personal connections offline."
1390,2,News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in a newspaper. What factors do you think influence their decisions? Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news was reported?,". There are two factors that influence their decisions. The first is the kind of customers they aim at. each kind of readers and watchers has its own features. For example, if your customers are almost entirely teenagers, you have to concentrate on something attracting them such as stories, photographs of singer stars, film stars, funny tales, and fashion. It be very silly if you to provide teenagers with economic or news. On the contrary, and politicians may never read news about James Blunt or Keira Knightley. Therefore, what influences news editors’ decisions the most is the taste of their customers.The second factor is how hot and attractive the news is. Who or watch news from a year or a month ago or even about something that happened last week? The answer is . In the energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for a really news. So that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. Or else, they may lose their customers. None of editors wants that bleak future.The type of news is also an important consideration. Whether on television or in newspapers, we seem to get more of and become used to bad news. It is harder for us to come across a piece of good news. We can’t deny that bad things happen on Earth day by day. However, news editors try to gain more and more , which means more and more money, using bad news as a magnet. bad news makes us curious. We want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. As a result, we will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. And the happiest people are, of course, news editors.In my view it would be better if more good news reported. Bad news makes us good news makes us happy. There should an an equal amount of good and bad news. In that way we can give something bad a lot of thought while still being happy about the good news. Any inequalities between good news and bad news should be avoided. Nowadays we cannot live without news, and for that reason the role of news editors became very important. We should support them, and in turn they should try their best to provide us with useful news, both good and bad.","Some of your sentences are too short – they would look better if joined together. Overall, this is a good essay, which seems to be worthy of Band 7.",,,,,7.0,"There are a few key things that news editors think about when choosing what stories to show on television or print in newspapers. One main factor is what people want to see or read, since keeping their audience interested is important for keeping their jobs and earning money. For instance, a newspaper aimed at older people might focus on political or economic issues, while a television station with young viewers might show more celebrity or entertainment news. Editors also look for stories that are recent and dramatic, because people are more likely to pay attention to news that feels urgent or shocking. As a result, we usually see more bad news, like crime or disasters, than good news. Over time, people can start to get used to hearing about these sad events, and it might even make them believe the world is worse than it really is. I believe it would definitely help if more good news was shared. Positive stories can inspire hope and help people feel better about their community. If editors included more good news, it might balance out our view of the world and remind us that not everything is negative. In the end, news editors should try to provide a mix of stories, so people can stay informed but also feel hopeful."

A single individual cannot be blamed for the world pollution, however every person should take care of his or her habitat. In addition, it is vital that environmental issues are treated internationally.Lately, many presentations, conferences and international summits are held to deal with waste treatment, recycling, and soil and water contamination. joint efforts and consolidation can only help in the mutual war the ongoing environmental disaster. For instance, governments should offer support to companies and organizations, involved in manufacturing, industry or agriculture in order to find environment-friendly approaches. These could be special law regulations, recycling programs, helping courses in order to implement ISO certificates and many more.However, the influence of individuals over environment should not be ignored. If we do not that our planet is our home, we will never be able to take care of it. We have to contribute every day to the preservation of nature and environment. For example, always remember to save energy by switching off lamps, computers and everything that we do not use. Our next obligation is to separate waste and throw bulk only in the designated areas. Driving vehicles can also be environment friendly. For example, we have to avoid accelerating the engines too rapidly or using the air conditioning in the country, where it would be better to save energy and simply open the windows.To sum up, environmental problems should be handled by local and international authorities as well as individuals.

Problems like air pollution, climate change, and deforestation do not stop at borders and are often caused by a mixture of actions from many different regions of the world.

International agreements such as the Paris Climate Accord show how countries can come together to set goals and share responsibilities for the health of the planet. However, this does not mean that individuals are powerless. Each person can make small changes in their daily lives, like reducing waste, conserving water, or using public transportation, which together can make a significant impact. Governments can also create laws to guide companies and citizens towards more sustainable practices, such as recycling or using renewable energy.

Solving environmental problems requires both large-scale international collaboration and personal commitment to caring for the earth."
1392,2,Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Capital punishment is always associated with ignorance and intolerance. In fact, we must acknowledge that some people disagree with this kind of penalty, but others vote in its favor. Portugal was the first European country to end this kind of penalty. Since the 19th century, tolerance and respect for life important values. Moreover, we can affirm that remains under the same codes. Maybe because of a religious view point, the respect for life is a typical value in the Old Catholic world.Those who are in favor of capital punishment mostly live in developing countries. However, this is not just an image of the Third World countries. Actually, the USA is one country where this kind of punishment has its rates of application. The state of Texas, in particular, is at the top, supporting this measure against crime, especially those involving serial killers and crimes against children. In a society dominated by fear and government control, it is foreseen that this penalty will continue .Maybe this is not a simple question. As we can see there are several values here and of course cultural behavior. The roots of the question are religious, cultural, ethical and even geographical. The world is divided and the law systems show this division. The solutions, however can lead us to other questions concerning revenge and justice. better to kill a person because of his crimes? Can we admit that a life sentence could be a much better sentence? In fact, rehabilitation is the right way especially with an accurate psychological evaluation first.

In this sense, capital punishment is an easy way out.","This is a good essay, you should do well in the Task 2 Writing Test.",,,,,7.0,"The debate on capital punishment continues to divide people across the world, with some seeing it as a necessary tool to maintain order, while others argue it violates human rights. Supporters of the death penalty claim that it is an effective deterrent against violent crime, suggesting that if criminals fear the prospect of execution, crime rates will fall and society will be safer. Countries such as China and Iran still enforce capital punishment, often pointing to public security as a justification. Yet, statistics from countries that have abolished the death penalty, like Canada and most of Europe, reveal that murder rates have not increased after its removal—on the contrary, some have decreased. It seems clear that the causes of violent crime are complex, often rooted in economic instability, social inequality, and lack of education, rather than in the severity of criminal penalties. Furthermore, the possibility of executing an innocent person is a risk that can never be completely eliminated, raising ethical concerns about justice. While the desire for security is legitimate, long prison sentences and rehabilitation might offer a more humane and effective solution. Personally, I believe that capital punishment is not essential for controlling violence, as addressing the root causes of crime and ensuring fair justice are more effective strategies in the long run."
1393,2,Should the same laws which prohibit the sale and consumption of heroin be applied to tobacco? Discuss.,"Recently, a heated debate when a few reputable health organizations suggested the application of a similar act of heroin selling and usage prohibition . In this , I will analyze why the adoption of such a law could be a breakthrough in our youngsters’ safety, according to my vision.Firstly, tobacco does not differ much from heroin when it comes to the addictive effect. , the active ingredient in tobacco, exerts its effect by acting directly on smoker’s brain cells. Numerous experiments carried out by on animals, rats, proved that this toxic chemical does lead time to dependency, similarly to the effect experienced with .Secondly, the restriction on selling would surely show an instant decline in tobacco smoking. ” Having easy access to cigarettes puts a tremendous pressure, especially on teenagers,to resist such a temptation” Dr.Hisham , head of department at Alexandria Medical college , states firmly. “Giving the new generation the sense that the severity of smoking is to other lethal drugs usage be a life saving step, they will thank us for as they get older.” he continues.To recapitulate, applying of a futuristic law such as the suggested one will have a positive impact ,not only on young people’s health but on our society as a whole.","Well done!

On one hand, it is undeniable that tobacco shares some commonalities with heroin, particularly in terms of its addictive nature and its serious consequences for users’ health. For instance, nicotine, the main chemical found in tobacco, affects the brain’s reward system in a manner not unlike that of heroin, making quitting an extremely difficult process for many smokers. Furthermore, statistical evidence shows that tobacco use leads to more deaths annually than many illegal drugs combined, which reinforces the argument that stronger legislative action could protect many lives, especially among young people. Nevertheless, one cannot ignore the deep-rooted cultural acceptance of tobacco and its economic importance to many communities, which would make enforcing such prohibitive laws exceptionally challenging. In conclusion, while the idea of treating tobacco and heroin alike in legal terms is compelling from a public health standpoint, it would require a significant societal shift and careful consideration of both social and economic impacts before such drastic measures could be implemented."

Or is this the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens?,"I think that wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer nations. at providing such things as food and education because of the three following reasons.Firstly, citizens of both wealthy nations and poorer nations are human beings. Therefore, we can not look at, hear of, or talk about people who lack food, education, without compassion and sympathy. Sharing wealth with poorer nations is not only a good deed but is also a .Secondly, many nations in Africa and Asia are poor. Famine, diseases, crime and illiteracy are killing the citizens of these countries. , many nations in Europe and America are rich. If there are no actions taken, this inequality will increase dramatically. Poor countries will become poorer while rich countries will become richer. As a result, the poorest countries will become slaves of the richest countries. So, sharing wealth is useful way to prevent people from that bad future.Thirdly, although sharing wealth with poorer nations is very necessarythis help should only stop at providing such things as food, medicine and education. Or else, poor nations may become dependent on the aid. They may lose enthusiasm to build their countries by themselves. Moreover, rich nations can take advantage of sharing wealth to interfere with the governance of poor nations’. This can’t be considered a humane action and should be prevented.In my opinion, sharing wealth with poorer nations has both a bad side and a good side. What we have to do is its bad side and its good side.","This is an excellent essay, your arguments are convincing and very well presented. There are only a few minor mistakes, please read and consider the comments. Well done!",,,,,7.0,"In my opinion, wealthy nations should take on some responsibility to assist poorer nations, especially when it comes to providing essential things like food, medicine, and education. First of all, all people deserve to have basic needs met, and it is simply fair for those who have more resources to help others who are suffering or in need. The gap between rich and poor countries causes huge problems, such as hunger and lack of access to schools, which can be eased if richer countries offer help. Also, when poor countries receive support, it can encourage overall global peace and cooperation, since people are less likely to be desperate or turn to crime. However, I believe this help should be limited to necessities and not go so far that poor nations start depending entirely on outside assistance. Each country’s government must also take responsibility for improving their own citizens’ lives so that outside aid just helps them get started, not makes them rely on aid forever. If rich nations give only what is needed for survival and education, and poor countries work hard to solve their problems, together the world can become more equal without creating more problems in the future."

For example, through advertisements on TV or the internet, people can find deals or discover innovative items that make daily life easier. In addition, advertising supports the media, funding television programs, websites, and radio stations so that we can access information and entertainment, often for free. On the other hand, many believe that advertising is a negative force in our lives as it can sometimes lead to unnecessary spending and materialism, especially among young people. Constant exposure to flashy ads can create a sense of dissatisfaction, making people want things they do not truly need and leading to impulse purchases that hurt their finances. From my perspective, advertising does serve a useful function by keeping us informed and supporting free content, but it needs to be approached critically. People should be aware of advertising’s persuasive techniques and make conscious decisions about what to buy, rather than being swayed by every message they see. In summary, while advertising has some advantages in connecting us to products and supporting media, it can also have negative effects, and it is important for individuals to maintain a balanced viewpoint and thoughtful consumption habits."

Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?","In the last two decades cybernetics have experienced a major breakthrough .This led to the utilization of computers in nearly all parts of our daily life, from personal computers to the ones performing complicated surgeries. Surely the uptake of this technology facilitates a lot of difficult tasks but is this excessive ripping the warmth out of our lives? .Most of the daily tasks individual experiences are time and effort consuming. These two qualities could be tremendously saved by the use of computers. The average period required to prepare a decent meal for a middle-class family is around an hour to hour and a half when using traditional methods. This time could be literally reduced to half if computerized are used instead. Moreover, a busy businessman is enabled to easily close a profitable deal with just a touch highly programmed laptop while enjoying his family vacation and not having to exert an extra effort of traveling long distances in order to a deal.On the other hand, new generations are growing remarkably dependent on these modern utilities, which makes them handicapped when it comes to a cup of tea. , psychologists suggest that one of the main reasons for rate increase is the recent electric inventions. This is due to the fact that humans by nature stay emotionally healthy through socializing, but due to the importance of modern technology to maintain a financially satisfying standard of life they gradually themselves. As time passes by each of these individuals gets stuck in a vicious circle of loneliness that eventually leads to suicidal attempts especially among youngsters.In conclusion, similarly to every other invention computers have their benefits and drawbacks, I personally think it all depends upon how we use the given tools . Moderation is the key here to keep the balance and allow us to live in harmony.","This is a good essay, nice vocabulary, a little too long (340 words instead of 250), a few grammatical mistakes. The topic is not fully covered (what about the “things will they be used for in future” part?).",,,,,7.0,"In today’s world, computers have become an essential part of everyday living, driving innovation and convenience in almost all areas. Looking ahead, it is expected that computers will be used for even more surprising advancements, such as self-driving cars, smart homes that anticipate our desires, and artificial intelligence capable of performing creative or highly complex tasks. On the positive side, this growing reliance allows us to solve problems faster, save time, and access information instantly. However, there is a concern that depending so heavily on computers may lead to people losing important life skills and human-to-human connections. In particular, young people may grow less capable of independent thinking, and society might face greater risks if systems are hacked or malfunction. Despite these worries, I think our dependence on computers can be a good thing if we use technology thoughtfully, ensuring that human values and direct social interaction are not forgotten. Ultimately, balancing the use of computers with mindful practices will help us take full advantage of their benefits while minimizing potential harm."
1397,2,"The Internet when used as a source of information, has more drawbacks than advantages. To what extent do you agree with this statement?","Some people believe that internet access creates problems. There are several possible reasons why it can happen.Firstly, some data may be unverifiable. For example, they search for a data, there would be lots of choices that would appear on the screen. They would not be sure if the information they are reading is accurate. Some sources may even have outdated . Secondly, some sites may be unreliable. For instance, people sign up on one site that sells goods online. The goods would be paid for by a credit card, but the purchaser would not receive anything. And finally, not everything is available through the net. When my friend had tried to research for some pictures of 18th century paintings, he did not find any results. Then he was told by his teacher that they would only be available in the library.Others believe that the Internet is very useful and these are the justifications. Firstly, it is hard to get the same data, that is available through the Internet by other means. For example, if the directory information could not give me the accurate address and contact number of a place I to visit, I normally check that information on the Internet. In just one click, I would get all the details of that company. Secondly, research becomes more comprehensive. For instance, I do not have to buy lots of reading materials to complete my research. Most of the needed information can be found if I have Internet access. And finally, data is easily compared and contrasted. researched a study about overweight children a decade ago and at presentwas able to finish his research in just one day, as compared to a week if he would not use the Internet.In conclusion, let me reiterate that the Internet plays a big role in our life, because it makes data retrieval and comparison easier.","This is a good essay, the arguments are clear, the language and the grammar are also fine. The structure needs to be improved a little bit – make paragraphs smaller, re-structure them to create 5 paragraphs from 4. In case of an argument essay – give your opinion in the conclusion only. In case of an opinion essay – give your opinion in the introduction",,,,,7.0,"The Internet is widely used as a source of information, but there are arguments both for and against its usefulness. On the negative side, there is a problem with the quality of information, since anyone can post data online even if it is false or misleading. For example, if a person looks for health advice, they might find unverified opinions on social media instead of facts from medical professionals. This can lead to misinformation spreading easily. Another drawback is the risk of privacy and security threats. Many people have experienced identity theft or scams because they shared their personal details on unreliable websites. However, there are also clear advantages. Many people enjoy the convenience of getting information instantly, which saves a lot of time compared to searching for books or newspapers. Students can access academic research, historical records, and expert opinions without leaving their homes. In addition, websites are frequently updated, so users can get the latest news in real time. In my opinion, although there are both pros and cons to using the Internet for information, its benefits such as instant access and a wide variety of sources make it more advantageous as long as users are careful to check the reliability of the information they find."
1398,2,Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree that this is the right course of action? Give reasons for your opinion.,", organization and companies as well as governments impose restrictions in work places and public amenities. It has become fashionable in the world today . I feel that smoking can be harmful, but I don’t think it should be forbidden completely. I would also argue that people should have the whether or not they should smoke.Allow me to present the three positive sides of smoking. Firstly, smoking certainly helps many people to relax. For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset or they have , to smoke to reduce the pressure or tension. people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends. Secondly, governments throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes. The income obtained through taxes provides funds which are used for building and public places such as parks, gardens, sports ground and foot paths. Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.Despite these positive are lots of negative effects to smoking too. Initially, smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health. cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer. According to a recent report in Britain close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems. Moreover, passive smoking is also a major concern today. Recent research shows that non-smokers can suffer from health problems if they spend long periods of time among people who do smoke. In the UK children whose parents are are three times as likely to start smoking themselves .In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision of whether smoke or not to smoke should be for each individual to make. I suggest that people should not smoke in a room or a place where there are non smokers, however they should be free to smoke elsewhere.","This is a very good essay, you have made your arguments well and set out the paragraphs as required. However, pay attention to your use of assertive statements e.g. ‘Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs’. Perhaps they would gain employment in another industry – we cannot be sure. Over all, well done!",,,,,7.0,"In recent years, the debate on restricting smoking in workplaces and public places has intensified, with many businesses and governments choosing to ban smoking in these areas. Personally, I support these restrictions because they are important for public health, safety, and general wellbeing. To begin with, smoking is hazardous not only to smokers but also to those nearby due to the dangers of passive smoking. Secondhand smoke has been linked to a range of health issues, such as respiratory problems and even cancer, making it unfair for non-smokers to be exposed against their will. In addition, banning smoking in public places can help reduce overall cigarette consumption, which in turn could lower medical costs related to smoking-related diseases. On the other hand, some people argue that such bans infringe on personal freedom, and that adults should have the right to choose whether or not to smoke. While individual freedom is important, I think it should not come at the expense of other people’s health and comfort. Furthermore, smokers are still free to smoke in designated areas or private spaces, which is a reasonable compromise. In conclusion, even though it is important to respect personal choices, I believe that prohibiting smoking in offices and public places is a justified measure to protect the health of the wider community."

There is also some repetition of words, which should be avoided. Overall, nicely done.",,,,,7.0,"It is very important for children to have discipline in their lives, but at the same time, giving them too many rules can have negative effects. If there are too many strict rules, children might feel stressed or lose confidence, because they do not have the chance to make their own decisions or learn from their mistakes. On the other hand, if children have no rules at all, they may lack self-control and could have trouble understanding boundaries or respecting others. Therefore, I believe that children should follow some reasonable rules that teach good behavior and responsibility, but they should also be allowed some freedom to explore, make choices, and express themselves. This balance helps them grow into mature and independent individuals who know how to behave respectfully while also being confident and creative. In conclusion, a moderate approach to rules—neither too strict nor too relaxed—is best for a child’s healthy development."

It at all to invest millions of dollars researching and producing foods for astronauts (for space exploration purpose), while every day thousands of people are starving. Furthermore, the discovery of outer space only serves a minor group of people if the majority well-educated. do no even know how to prevent common threatening diseases such as AIDS and lung cancer.Then, some may argue that the purpose of space exploration to discover new lands, new energy resources or to deter potential threat to . Nevertheless, is it effective to do so while other alternatives are available? yet effectively used. New energy resources (e.g. solar and nuclear energy) have not yet been widely-used. Threats of plagues have not yet been deterred. All of these tasks that haven’t been tackled yet require money. That is why costly space discovery programs are a waste of resources.In a nutshell, people should only invest in space exploration provided that urgent and important matters mentioned earlier in this essay have been solved. Also, purposes of space exploration campaigns should be studied carefully and other alternatives should be considered before the money is wasted.","This is a very good essay, well done.",,,,,7.0,"There is no doubt that space exploration has led to impressive scientific breakthroughs, but considering the many serious issues facing humanity today, it seems irresponsible to spend so much money on projects in outer space. Every day, millions of people lack access to clean water, basic health care, and education, yet governments continue to devote billions of dollars to launching rockets and sending probes beyond our planet. While some may argue that space exploration could eventually help us find new resources or protect us from future dangers, these benefits are hypothetical and distant compared to the urgent crises on Earth right now. For example, investing in renewable energy technology, disease prevention, and food security would directly improve people's lives and help solve real world problems. Until our most pressing challenges like poverty and climate change have been meaningfully addressed, it is difficult to justify such extravagant spending on space missions. In summary, the money devoted to space exploration would be far better spent on causes that have immediate, tangible benefits for society as a whole."

But now with the help of the internet, we can send messages instantly through emails, social media, or chats, allowing for quick and simple communication. Not only can we write messages, but we can also see and hear each other in real-time using video calls, which brings people even closer together.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"The World Cup football and the Olympics are held worldwide with great national support and expectations. As a fan of those competitions, I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity, but only partially, because such events can have unintended effects on relationships between countries.First of all, the World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations. For example, South and North Korea have football games regularly two nations a chance to understand each other . In the mid of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events. Even if it sounds ridiculous, many South Koreans were quite surprised at that moment when North Koreans shouted and cried during the match. We all realized that they were very normal sports fans even though they were occasionally very secretive. Through the sports, two divided nations could reduce their political and ideological tensions and could feel the patriotic unity.On the other hand, some sports matches can make international relations worse. For instance, football or baseball games between Korea and Japan are always big matches in two countries where . Sometimes, after the matches, the two rivals blame each other and their patriotic emotions explode in an aggressive way. scenario is that the troubles caused by losing games affect the players directly.","In conclusion, I think that international sporting occasions can be one of the good ways to ease tensions or to release patriotism safely. However, I believe that games can not be the fundamental ways for the sound patriotism or peaceful international relations.",,,,,7.0,"International sporting events like the Football World Cup and the Olympics indeed have significant impacts on both global relations and patriotic feelings. Personally, I believe these events mostly help ease international tensions and let people express nationalism in a positive way, though there are some exceptions. Firstly, these competitions bring together athletes and fans from many countries, creating opportunities for cultural exchange and mutual understanding. For example, when countries compete fairly on the field, it shows that disagreements can be set aside in favor of sportsmanship and respect. Moreover, cheering for one's nation often unites people at home, giving them a safe outlet for national pride. However, these events are not without risk. Sometimes, heated rivalries or controversial results can actually create more conflict or negative feelings between countries, leading to insults or even violence among extreme fans. Despite this, the overall effect of these competitions is usually positive, promoting peace and providing a platform for nations to connect through shared passion for sports. Therefore, while not perfect, international sporting events generally contribute to easing tensions and channeling patriotic emotions constructively."
1403,2,Students from rural areas often find it difficult to access university education. Some people think that it should become easier for them to study at universities. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Nowadays, it is acknowledged that students from suburban areas find it tough to receive higher education. Whether it should be made easier for them to access university education becomes an ongoing concern, which incurs a highly-charged debate.Obviously, higher education opportunities bring about benefits to students in multiple ways. For example, higher education becomes increasingly important to senior high school graduates, partly it determines if they have the competitive edge in the job market, and partly because it is seen as a guarantee of a certain level of the mental ability, from the computer literacy that is required by the most employers to the capacities of acquiring new knowledge the soonest possible which is valued by most . With a university degree, students from rural areas obtain a job easily, thereby bettering their living conditions and their family as well.Higher education also, however, to impose a heavy burden on families since the rise in the tuition fees are increasingly beyond those families’ ability to afford. In addition, with the mounting evidence, a university degree is not always a guarantee of seizing a decent job; therefore, their living conditions are likely to able to earn back their tuition fee after graduation. people argue, students from rural areas are not well-advised to pursue a university degree. But I perceive their desire to further their education should not be disrespected and the government should subsidise them to receive higher education.In conclusion, university education should be made fair to everyone, predicated only on their academic performance and mental abilities, rather than their financial capacities and the government should subsidise those students in need.Teacher’s comment: Not all the parts of the task were covered.

On one hand, providing easier access would give these students the chance to benefit from higher education, including better job prospects, improved skill sets, and the potential to break the cycle of poverty in their communities. When rural students attend university, they not only gain valuable knowledge but also may return to their hometowns and contribute positively, helping with local development. On the other hand, making university too easy to access for rural students could raise concerns about fairness and educational standards, especially if academic requirements are lowered or if resources are spread too thin. However, I believe that with appropriate support, such as scholarships, preparatory courses, and better information about university opportunities, the playing field can be leveled without compromising quality. It is essential that university access is determined by ability and effort rather than geography or family income. Therefore, while easier access should not mean lower standards, I strongly agree that rural students should be supported through thoughtful policies that address their unique obstacles, ensuring that talent from all parts of the country has the chance to flourish."

Many important skills, such as teamwork, leadership, and communication, can be developed by joining clubs, playing sports, or taking up part-time jobs. These experiences can help students grow as individuals and become more well-rounded. On the other hand, focusing solely on study can cause stress and even lead to burnout, which can negatively affect academic performance. Some students may argue that other activities distract from their main goal, but if managed well, these experiences can actually refresh the mind and help them study better. To sum up, while education is crucial, engaging in activities outside the classroom is equally important for personal development and a balanced university experience."

People who embrace change often gain a broader perspective of the world and learn to solve problems more quickly. In my view, while stability is important, especially for those who value consistency or are at a stage in life where peace of mind matters, change should not be avoided altogether. Embracing some changes—even small ones—can keep life interesting and help people grow, but it is important to balance new experiences with the need for security depending on one’s individual situation."

Many students are able to find programs better suited to their career goals, which may not be available at home. Furthermore, living and learning in a foreign country gives students the chance to become fluent in another language and to experience a different culture, both of which can be valuable skills in today’s global job market. Students also have an opportunity to develop independence and gain new perspectives by meeting people from all over the world. However, there are challenges as well.

Without this knowledge, students may grow up making poor financial decisions, such as overspending or falling into debt soon after they start earning. In contrast, some believe that the responsibility of teaching children about money belongs mainly to parents rather than schools, and that adding such subjects may increase students’ workload. However, I think making financial education mandatory in schools would properly prepare students for real-life situations that they might not otherwise learn at home. By introducing lessons on how to balance a budget, understand interest rates or evaluate financial risks, schools can help form a solid foundation for students’ futures. To conclude, although parents play an important role, having financial education as a mandatory subject can offer all young people equal opportunities to learn essential life skills they will need as adults."
1408,2,The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise age limit for the younger drivers and to lower age limit for the aged ones. Do you agree?,"With the rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the with hush and rush lifestyles of drivers today, traffic accidents seem to be escalating in our society. partly to number of traffic accidents but surely not as the main factor.Those who agree with would view young drivers assuming under 18 years old and older drivers to be reckless and therefore would be more prone to traffic accidents on the road. Lack of experience, forgetfulness, carelessness and poor fitness condition may be reasons for limiting age of drivers.On the other hand, I would think that age is only a small determinant and we need to look at more effective measure such as reducing number of vehicles on the road through car pool, implementing more stringent regulations on alcohol drink driving and possibly to revise on the standard of driving test for young and old drivers on the road. Many drivers who are stuck in traffic jams also have busy lifestyles and therefore tend to become very stressed or distracted on the road. Thus I would think the government may have to look ways to improve road infrastructure and traffic jams to deter or reduce accidents on the road.To sum up, age is only one of the many contributors for accidents but I do not agree that age for the elderly and raising age limit for the younger drivers is the best method. As mentioned in my third paragraph, we need to look at other more effective measures which deal with the underlying problems in the society which lead to traffic accidents.","This essay needs some work.

Overall, looks like a Band 6.5 essay.",,,,,6.0,"While it is often suggested that raising the minimum driving age for young people and lowering the maximum for older individuals could help decrease traffic accidents, I believe this solution overlooks more significant causes behind these incidents. It is true that younger drivers may lack experience, and older drivers may sometimes face challenges related to slower reaction times or reduced physical ability. However, not all accidents are caused by age alone. Often, factors like distracted driving, speeding, lack of awareness, or even driving under the influence play a bigger role in road accidents. In my opinion, introducing more thorough and regular testing for all drivers regardless of age, as well as promoting safe driving education and strict enforcement of traffic rules, would do more to address the root of the problem. Additionally, improvements in road conditions and public transportation options could reduce the overall number of vehicles and relieve traffic congestion, further decreasing accident rates. Ultimately, focusing only on age restrictions might be too simplistic; a truly effective approach must consider the many factors influencing driver safety."
1409,2,Dieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruins one’s health completely. What’s your opinion?,"Dieting seems to be of our life in this modern society, especially for those who are health conscious. Different people choose different type of dieting methods, trying to achieve what they believe to be good for either their health or physical appearance. In general, most of the people who diet are focusing on controlling their weight.In our urban society, most of the working class not have the opportunity to consume . Their daily meals consist of fast food which contains large amounts of fat and salt. The most significant of this unhealthy lifestyle is the weight gain especially among those middle age working professionals.Therefore, most of these young and energetic people have to control their diet in order to stay in shape either for their appearance or health. The most common and proper method of maintaining one’s weight is eating less oily food, preferably more green vegetables, fruits and alcohol.However, some have resorted to losing weight by taking their diet to the extreme, not eating at all for days. Others will make themselves vomit after each meal. Many others will go for dieting medication and beverages that help them to lose their appetite. These unhealthy will cause internal damage in the long run.In my opinion, dieting for better health is more important than solely for looking attractive. Individuals who wish to control their weight should seek professional if they are unable to reduce their weight after switching over to a healthy diet for a period of time. Losing weight and losing your health at the same time does not benefit any individual.This essay needs some work.

Overall, this looks like a Band 6 essay.",,,,,6.0,"Dieting is an increasingly common practice in today’s society, with many people believing it is the best way to enhance their health and physical appearance. While there are undeniable benefits to monitoring one’s food intake, such as improved energy levels and reduced risk of chronic diseases, extreme or misguided dieting can lead to serious health issues. Some individuals adopt balanced diets, incorporating more vegetables and cutting down on processed foods, which can lead to long-term wellbeing. However, others follow dangerous trends, like skipping meals or relying on fad diets that cut out entire food groups, resulting in nutritional deficiencies and even psychological problems such as eating disorders. In my view, the purpose and method of dieting should always prioritize overall health rather than just rapid weight loss or societal ideals of beauty. With proper guidance and realistic expectations, dieting can indeed change a person’s life for the better; but without caution, it risks causing more harm than good."
1410,2,"Even though globalization affects the world’s economy in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten.

Our first thoughts about this topic include the process of global “McDonaldisation” and, generally speaking, spreading across the whole Globe.Firstly, I would try to concentrate on the positive aspects of globalisation. As far as economy is concerned, like the Global Bank or IMF are always focused on developing the ‘Third World’ and helping poor people to combat their life obstacles (through loans and donations). Moreover, the world becomes an area of sharing thoughts (e.g. philosophical or economical doctrines), which become popular due to lack of barriers.However, disadvantages of globalization are also widely known. Some people insist that because of this process, the spirit of countries and nations rapidly disappears. The integrity, established years ago is on the verge of collapsing. Furthermore, there’s a strong lobby of communists who , that the globalization indicates an uncontrolled reign of capitalists and slave work of lower labour-class. We should never forget about the detrimental impact of global investments on the environment – the green house effect or soar rains are triggered by globalization.To sum up, globalization has both positive and negative influence on our everyday life. I can’t agree with the popular statement that we should try to avoid being affected by it. However, we must not forget about our surroundings and local communities. They have a great value which should last forever.","This essay is too short (233 words instead of mandatory 250), which may get it penalized.

Huge firms can now invest and open branches all around the world, which for many nations means more jobs and faster development. In addition, easier access to foreign markets can help small companies grow and people find unique goods at lower prices than ever before. Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to ignore the darker sides of globalization. The disappearance of local businesses and cultures is a real issue as international corporations dominate the market, often pushing traditional ways to the background. Workers in developing countries may also suffer from poor working conditions just to meet the global demand for cheap products. Furthermore, the environment pays a high cost, with increased transportation and industrialization leading to pollution and climate change. In conclusion, while the positive impact of globalization on the world’s economy cannot be overlooked, it is necessary to remember and address its negative aspects to create a fair and sustainable future for everyone."
1411,2,"In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it to be a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion on this?","In the Third World, children are usually sent to factories for laborious work. Many people believe that it is merely exploitation, while others think it is a good opportunity for them to life experience. In any case, children have their right to live and study in peaceful conditions. Therefore, using them as workforce is considered an unacceptable action.First of all, children are not workers. They have just learned about the vast world and do not have any experience or concept of working. Since these innocent children are naive and , they can be easily cheated and exploited. There are many examples of this in poor nations. Because using children is cheap and to control, many enterprises hire them and don’t pay them much. Although the government in these countries has tried its best, this kind of taking advantage of children cannot be eliminated.Moreover, children do not need such thing as ‘valuable work experience’ that is supposedly ‘important for learning and taking responsibility’. The brief responsibility of children is learning. They are not old enough to understand what working experiences are. Nevertheless, they can help parents do chores or housework. This will be a much better way for them to become more responsible for . In addition, childhood is one of the most remarkable memories and must not be taken away by forcing them to work.In conclusion, since all children are the great concern of parent and society, they should be allowed to enjoy life and rather than to work. Hence, one must ponder what view is actually appropriate for the sake of the children.","This is a good essay.

Some argue that this practice deprives children of their right to a carefree and healthy childhood, while others claim that having a job can teach useful skills and prepare youngsters for future responsibilities. I personally believe that putting children into paid labor is mostly wrong, especially when it interferes with their education or exposes them to unsafe conditions. Children should be able to focus on their studies and personal growth without the stress of earning money or facing adult pressures too early. There are countless cases where young workers are overworked and underpaid, particularly in poorer countries where laws may not protect them. Such experiences can harm both their physical and mental development. It is true that learning responsibility is a good thing, but this can be achieved at home or through voluntary activities rather than paid jobs. Overall, society has a duty to protect the well-being of its youngest members, and I think children should be given time to enjoy their youth and build a strong foundation for the future rather than being forced into the world of work too soon."

Also, the Internet offers a greater variety of viewpoints, since you can read articles from journalists all over the world, as well as comments and opinions from regular people.

1414,2,The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for aged drivers. Do you agree ?,"Traffic accidents are on the rise these days. Most of the accidents injuries or death. Research have found that most of the accidents are caused by inexperienced drivers, for example young drivers.Young drivers tend to be more daring and are unable to avoid a crush when they face one. They tend to be more daring after drinking alcohol at night and this causes them to lose control of the car. Drunk driving will not only risk a person’s own life but may also cause an life to be lost.The government should encourage the driving to conduct driving lessons for drivers for a longer period. This will give them a clear picture about how accidents happen and teach them about the safety of others on the road. Drivers that have been in an accident after drunk driving should be from driving for at least two years and be given driving lessons again.However, for the aged drivers, the government should not only the age limit but also check the capability of the aged drivers for instance eyesight, hearing and other related health conditions to ensure safe driving. It does not mean that an aged person not fit to drive and has a problem with the heart but a young or a middle aged person could also have heart failure these days.To conclude, I feel that to raise the of young drivers not the best solution but to about the problems they may encounter on the road and to ban them from driving if they have caused an accident due to carelessness.

Instead, I think that proper driver education and frequent testing for all drivers are more effective solutions. For example, young drivers could be required to have more hours of supervised driving and pass tougher driving tests, while older drivers could take regular medical check-ups to ensure they are still fit to drive safely. Experience, maturity, and health differ for every person, so simply using age to decide who can drive seems unfair.
